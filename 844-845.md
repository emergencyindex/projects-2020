The shape-shifting alien clown Old Put is back for another puppet drama where they start their own YouTube channel to unbox corn husk dolls for an audience online. Old Put's sentient video camera captures ghosts and an Old Put doppelg√§nger in the recorded footage. Chaos ensues as the world questions the legitimacy of Spiritualism.
