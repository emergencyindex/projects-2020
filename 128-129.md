“Catação” (Picking) took place on Instagram in the online festival “Mizura em Rede” @mizura.performance – in the months of June and July 2020. I covered my head with paper strips, whose words were chosen by some friends and myself, that referred to bad feelings we lived during the quarantine. 

I presented people with the following sentence: what feelings would you like to get rid of? According to their suggestion that they interacted by typing, I removed the paper strips one by one with the help of tweezers, depositing them inside a clay container. I kept looking until my face was completely clean and ended up burning all the words. This action aimed to discuss the pandemic moment and the fears that affected us. It was a way, perhaps, of easing the anxieties of those difficult days, and a time to share what each one was feeling. Burning was a way to get rid of those bad energies, creating through art another enjoyment that would bring the soul a little peace.
