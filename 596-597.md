“MAMA” is a private live performance, performed at a home studio. I locked myself with my two children in an empty room for three hours. I set the camera and pressed record. I tirelessly repeated the same words “I want to be a good artist, I want to be a good mama” while the kids were coping with a new setting and trying to interact with their mother.

For the entire three hrs, I repeated this sentence over and over again. I measured the mother and child relationship to highlight the ambiguity of social values and the paradoxes of the socio-political artist-mother status in the art world.
