The cleaning of utensils is like preparing yourself for a new process and getting rid of impurities and dirt. Different shapes and sizes of utensils are giving form to your emotions and thinking. Every human has a particular vessel which is their favourite; they form a shape to their thoughts. Vessels are the container of soul, body and mind. Through this vessel, we can do a process to distil and purify. We can see a reflection of our souls. Reflect a universe within the body of a vessel.

The act of repetitiveness and cleansing is a ritual and an exercise to attain a “Nirvana.” This work is metaphorical and surreal in nature. This work was inspired from an ancient path to Nirvana by a Japanese Buddhist ritual where monks are supposed to do a thousand times circumambulation of mountain Mt. Omine to attain “Nirvana” among monks. The Thousand Day Circumambulation is considered a somewhat shortcut to enlightenment. I attempted to understand this simple philosophy through the mundane job of cleansing vessels, finding bliss and enlightenment in simple acts of repetition and everyday work. I have metaphorically used these vessels as a container of our souls. The title is double-edged: one part talks about higher attainment and spiritual dimension and another part is satirical, responding to the present situation when the phrase “Atma-nir-bhar” can refer to issues faced by women in a household without any helpers during lockdown. The pandemic has made it possible to search and explore inner solace even in mundane work and compensate for the hollowness of these vessels with blissful emotions. This container also created more space within fallout hollowness.
