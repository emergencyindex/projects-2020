Erin and Cynthia presented a diptych of images that consider duality / the absolute / the indefinite. Their image-making seen in process, positioned neutral / coincidental / contradictory / improvised / interdependent movements while occupying individual digital frames. They explored the inherent qualities of sameness and opposition that a pair presents in this context.

<span class="ITALIC">An account according to Erin</span>

<span class="ITALIC">I stood with my back against black chalkboard wall and faced Cynthia on the computer screen in front of me. I held a piece of white chalk in my right hand and began to trace the perimeter of my body onto the chalkboard wall behind me. </span>

<span class="ITALIC"> </span>

<span class="ITALIC">Cynthia and I traced our bodies and synchronized our movements by gazing at each other on the screen. We each used the body and pace of the other as a reference to guide the movement for our own mark making. We were each other’s mirrors. </span>

<span class="ITALIC"> </span>

<span class="ITALIC">I followed Cynthia’s body outline while interrogating the perimeter of my own body with chalk. Despite distance and disembodiment, this act of mirroring created a state of shared consciousness for both of us as we faced each other through the screen and  created a live liminal state for the online viewer sandwiched somewhere between.</span>

 

 

<span class="ITALIC">An account according to Cynthia</span>

<span class="ITALIC">Back to the wall, left to right, eyes centered. With each movement, I watched you and traced the contours of your body. As my gaze softened, blurred, over time, I began to lose myself. Was my hand moving yours, or yours mine? Did you shift your weight left to right, or did I? Was I the manipulator or the manipulated? It was as if I was looking in the mirror, and the body in front of me commanded my every move. But...perhaps I was commanding you.</span>

<span class="ITALIC">I imagined the viewer in between us, sandwiched between our gaze.</span>
