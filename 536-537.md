I created “To Whom it may Concern” to highlight the world’s need to question our behaviors and how we treat the planet. The performance consists of grabbing and packing materials into envelopes, writing questions on the envelopes, and placing the envelopes into a briefcase. I repeat the process until the briefcase is overflowing, then I attempt to shut the briefcase. Our behaviors are usually harmful and go for long periods without being addressed. The materials I use consist mainly of soil and discarded materials.
