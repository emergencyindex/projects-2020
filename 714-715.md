Q: What did you do in the darkness?

A: We breathed and made some light.

(On that day at twilight a parade of sorts set out from the edge of town)

Performer A was building castles out of sand while Performer B tried to approximate the flavor of blackberry jam by ringing a bell. Performer C wanted to be a lighthouse for the mesa waves and Performer D cracked multiple nuts looking for the dusk within.  Performer E collected amplified echoes from the stars and used them to push a land sail up and down through the dusty hills to where Performers F and G had donned their helmets and set up a teeter totterâ€”a reminiscing rehearsal of how to play ping pong through a mirror. SEE/SAW is about the sound of it, and when you meet the highway you take a right.
