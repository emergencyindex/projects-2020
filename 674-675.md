“Divide et Impera” was created in May 2020. I had an image before my eyes: I chop water. As the message “Divide et Impera” is a key principle of strategy, we all fight the battles of our lives in one way or another. My life is like splitting water with an ax. I probably have too little strength, chopping with too little intensity to break up the water. Or maybe you can’t demand so much? 

In ancient myths, water symbolizes primordial chaos. 

The performance took place in an invasion of public space. Location: Lake Lampedis in Kaunas. I put on my suit—a hint of Western civilization—took a long-legged ax, and broke into the water. After that, I chopped the water strongly and monotonously. The performance lasted 20 minutes and my friend filmed it all. He was the only spectator of the performance. After that, I edited a five-minute, black-and-white, silent video. This video is uploaded to YouTube.
