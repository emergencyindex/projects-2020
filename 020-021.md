This performance was part of the project “Meetings with Remarkable and Unremarkable Trees” that I began in 2020. The title of the artistic research project alludes to the photography book Meetings with Remarkable Trees (1996) by Thomas Pakenham and in some sense forms a counterpoint to it by questioning the distinction between *remarkable* and *unremarkable*. Although we are often accused of “not seeing the forest for the trees,” this project wants to look at the opposite danger—not seeing the trees for the forest. During a residency in Johannesburg, from February to March of 2020, the first tree I made acquaintance with was a huge oak tree growing in the yard of the bed and breakfast I stayed at in Parkview. The owner told me that the oak trees in the area were imported by a major who came from Kilkenny in Ireland and named the suburbs Irish names. It was a tree with which I could easily perform daily, so I decided to record a brief moment with the tree every day, if possible, doing a simple yoga pose—simply reaching up with my arms, raising my heels, standing on my toes and trying to stay there. I did not need any further challenge, as just trying to stand on my toes for a moment was hard enough, and I practiced this pose next to the old oak tree (almost) every day between February 13 and March 16, 2020. The performances were documented online and the video, *With the Oak on Galway Road*, comprises all 31 performances. When my stay in Johannesburg was interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and I had to return to Helsinki, I started another performance there, with a maple tree in the yard at home, and have since performed the same pose for approximately a month with several other trees.
