"Uncertain Journeys" is a co-body-based performance that draws on Chinese Kung Fu and yogic shamanism. I developed this work during the Covid-19 pandemic as it was impractical to travel to perform this work live. The work was created as a way to look into the tropes of oriental mysticism in which the body is placed within a precarious and possibly dangerous situation—such as being surrounded by hot coals or on beds of nails—while the performer uses their mind and concentration to navigate this terrain. Moreover, the work is about walking in circles and seemingly getting nowhere as well as the dangers inherent to living in our current climate of dangerous health situations, violent and unjust politics, and strained social relations. “Uncertain Journeys” is a piece that looks inward. The actions require great mental focus and meditation. So, it is a performance that says even walking in circles and not really getting anywhere can still be a great vehicle for advancing oneself.
