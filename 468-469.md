“Poor Connection” touches on the struggle of staying connected with a partner that is far away. It references the use of technologies, such as FaceTime or Skype, as a tool to stay connected with your loved one. I wanted to focus on the struggle I feel with keeping connected with my partner while we are 400 miles apart. Even with the help of things like FaceTime to keep us connected when we are apart there are still difficulties that come along with that, such as the dreaded poor connection screen.   

“Poor Connection” is performed solely by me. I sit in front of a computer that is playing a video of my partner. We stare at each other for over 4 minutes. The performance ends when the screen goes to black, and all that is left is me sitting in front of the blank computer screen with only the light from the screen washing over my face.

 

“Poor Connection” ends with me left by myself, the only audience gathered around me. I sit wiping tears from my eyes. The connection I have with my partner is strong but sometimes the distance complicates our relationship.
