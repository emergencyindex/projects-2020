My current artistic intervention is a “ritualistic make-up” concerning a spiritual-craft that is fully composed of simple colored plastic tape—“mummy-bandaging.” This Mummy is part of a long duration inquiry for crossed-ancestralities under an attitude of being—under possession or in a trance (activating some of the diaspora old technologies). It also deals with “suffocating” (not quite a metaphor these days) as-being the mask-layer itself or the very artistic support upon my body (and it would r...e...s...o...n...a...t...e with bondage aesthetics), sometimes including a long needle to beseech inherited sewing-contact by trespassing my bleeding out of drawing over the immediate landscape this body holds. This experiment involves the expanded-body as conceived by the so-called Body-Art in terms of a Mummy resurrection for the uncountable bodies of violated minorities (as such, black, trans women, lgbtqia+, among others). It should be acknowledged that this work faces my immigrant status of living in the periphery of an exchange country within the Iberian world, myself once born into a poor unfaced villa somewhere in Northeastern Brazil.
