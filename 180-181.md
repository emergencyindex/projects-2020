In the performance "Corona World Test", I used a large number of white medical masks, which are now used to protect against infection by the Covid-19 virus. I lined up the masks along the entire length of the SULUV gallery in Novi Sad (Serbia). Then I tied all the masks together with black and yellow warning self-adhesive tape. I lay down on this snake-like floor installation, and glued the beginning of the coil to the middle of my body. Then I rolled on the floor, wrapping the bound medical masks around myself. On the back of the mask were copies of banknotes of 100 dollars and 100 euros. The money was revealed to the audience as I wrapped it around my body at the end of the performance. The current pandemic, which is likely to last for a very long time, is an ideal test for the individual, society, national and world economy, culture and life.
