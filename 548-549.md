MEAT///INJECTION is a reclamation of desire and agency, in the face of violence and medicalization of trans bodies. Against a sound collage derived from news reports, medical information videos, pop culture references, and some recordings of original text, C. Bain, Stephon, and Summer Minerva used movement to interpret the condition of being in a queer, desiring body, which is also the target of violence. I described this, in development, as a piece about body horror, bottoming, and the defilement of the sexual object. By exploring the body as permeable, either in the submissive sexual act, or in the face of medical intervention, we look to the key to our survival in the part of us that has been most attacked.Who am I when thereâ€™s something else inside me. How do I transform what I receive. Importantly, there were no cis men involved in this piece; there was no figuration of the top, as either the locus of desire or the perpetrator. Rather, our movement work was an exploration of femininity and erotic diffusion, seeking its own development without moving towards an other. The movement score was generated collaboratively. We wore black lingerie and combat boots. The lights were jewel colored, saturated. Although some gesture-sequences did recur, there was no definite narrative. We all looked extremely hot and gay.
