WHAT IF WALLS COULD TALK?

Heide Hatry

As I see it, there are two models of thought, which apply to politics, economics, sociology, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, and even to literature: the bridge model and the wall model, though even the makers of medieval castles understood that some combination of the two is necessary for a viable life, both security and the extension of trust, neither of which can truly exist without the other.

The bridge model implies openness, sharing, integration, communication, progress, and, perhaps, erosion of identity, while the wall model asserts isolation, tribalism, privacy, secrecy, fear, and yes, protection. 

In wall societies, the insinuation of bridge values has often proven to be a means of introducing salutary change; if painting or writing on walls has not in itself brought them down, it certainly contributed to the disintegration of the internal walls of which they are but a physical projection. And in the lives of members of walled societies, their surfaces often became the only forum in which “outside” ideas have had  a chance of penetrating, or even of preparing the understanding that those ideas, too, come from within and cannot be prevented from arising by means of a wall. 

The artist, the poet, the revolutionary, those who write on walls, are spiritual adventurers, driven by the need to know and engage what is on the other side, what is beyond where we are today. They become the voice for the rest of us who yearn in silence, often not understanding that we yearn at all until their words and images awaken us to other possibilities.

This performance, in which I climb and then fall from a wall, commissioned for  screening only, on account of the pandemic, in Karachi, Pakistan.

*If Walls Could Talk* is an evocation of the arduous, often solitary struggle of the artist on behalf of us all, and the ultimate irrelevance of any particular artist to the course of humanity. She may speak for us all, but it is all of us who must read and understand and integrate what she reveals to us of ourselves. The work of the artist is everyone’s legacy and everyone’s responsibility; her journey is our journey. Her ascent is the ascent of humankind.
