During the “Fragile Monuments” durational performance, I was standing under the Murano chandelier at the main hall of the Palazzo Morra, in Venice. I was wearing only a hospital gown that I was taking off and putting on, while I was rotating around for five hours. The action was a statement about my ongoing fight with cancer. My goal was to see the body as a cultural monument that needs to be preserved and restored because it has been exposed to damaging environmental conditions, like Venice itself. During the performance there were times that I needed the hospital gown and times that I didn’t. This performance taught me that I have to give my body time to fight the disease and accept that I cannot fast forward this process. This action falls under the performance series “IODINE-131” and aims to challenge the stereotypes around cancer, symptomless disease and invisible disability while raising awareness about the rise of thyroid cancer in people of a young age.
