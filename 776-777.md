Rice is one of the most common foods in Chinese culture, and is inherently a symbol of identity. During the nationwide level 3 pandemic alert in Taiwan, I spent most of my time at home cooking. As I underwent that period of unprecedented strange times, I often dwelled on the question: what is our relationship with food? To be able to consume the basic meals everyday, despite all the sudden hardships, is perhaps one of life's little blessings."Rice, Water and Me #2" is a piece of live performance that speaks about an issue concerning food in the midst of a global pandemic. On an inconspicuous stairway, I used my body to inch up to the rooftop while carrying a bag of rice and a bag of ice. The performance venue was situated on a highland very near to the ocean. Hence, the use of ice is my response to the element of water. The act of moving slowly up the stairs using the limited strength of my body along with the two large bags of ice and rice, which require time to melt into water, is a metaphor for the long and arduous process of growing rice. Upon reaching the rooftop, I took out the rice and ice from the bags, stacking the ice on top of the rice on the narrow dwarf wall curb. Lastly, I started to blow the rice and ice, and as a result, they were dropping onto the stairway.
