In the role of ‘transmuter’ I conducted the fourth iteration of this engagement series, the individual events defined as ‘considerations,’ while completing an artist residency program in Reykjavik, Iceland. My fellow residents, defined as ‘seekers’ were asked to quiet the mind and locate a secret within. Together, we will create a void in waking reality that allows for new growth -- only you know what you need. 

I invited seekers to choose one of the twenty-two sculptures made in collaboration with the mediums of time and nature, specifically a volcano. These objects were defined as ‘options,’ igneous pieces of basalt, having formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. This oceanic island basalt is composed of rhyolite and because it is highly viscous, favors explosive eruptions over effusive ones; it sprouted from Gaia herself as goddess Athena was born from the forehead of Zeus. It will outlast you, but what else did you expect from the center of mother earth? 

Paint made of red ochre collected from below the outdoor stairs of the residence was added to each option in order to locate the time and place. Seekers placed their option on a chosen part of the body while internally considering its physical properties of color, texture, weight, composition, place of origin, and current state of existence. Are you happy? We took a firm grip on it, listened to it, smelled it, tasted it. Did it tell you something?

As the transmuter, I read a previously prepared long-form text to aid seekers in isolating their most omnipresent desire as tectonic plates spread at a rate of 2.5 cm per year below us. In the context of the many definitions of the term ‘settle’ and through articulated breathing, desires were visualized outside of the body, as planetary wonders to play with and admire, rotating at supersonic speeds to gradual implosion until forming the most perfect sphere in the known Universe. Can you see that your option now houses your wonder? A perfect union, a shelter, a resting place, a lighthouse. 

This activity was intended to collectively examine the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, substance and attribute, potentiality and actuality. This consideration was presented by The Truth Guide For A Beginner’s Mind®, which is an ongoing public engagement series that considers the most common and unending of pursuits -- to feel satisfied, fulfilled, complete.
