We stood in front of two mirrors on opposite sides of the country: one from an attic in Providence and the other from a bedroom in Seattle. Then we called each other on a video chat platform and turned our phones to face the mirrors. We began swinging our phones back and forth in a smooth motion, for the effect of being on a swing inside a telephone. In the screen recording of the performance, we get the experience of sitting on a swing set together.
