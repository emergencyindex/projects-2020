“Stay Sane” is a drive-in performance in response to current stay-at-home orders and a ceremony for the death of live performances within the proscenium. I was inspired by guerilla-style performance, drive-in movie theatres, and processionals. Guests are sent an invitation via text message, encouraged to socially distance themselves by remaining in their vehicle, and could invite people within their recent contact pool to join them. Once guests arrived, the performance began with myself leading a procession to another destination on foot where the actual performance took place. Music was played through the speakers of the leading car and video documented from that perspective. The entire experience lasted a duration of twenty minutes for discretion and offered a short break from the anxieties that came with adjusting to quarantine.
