“Conductive Wire” consists of a single vesture to be used by two people at the same time imposing the sculptural condition for those who share the time of about 50 minutes in the same exhibition space. The duration of the action is marked by the winding of a metronome in the slower rhythm.

In this action, we see reflections already evoked in procedural drawings, in sculptural objects and in previous performance works, with an uninterrupted thread that includes several visual constructions that present hybrid bodies through a queer perspective, whose expressions approach dance, sculpture, and clothing at once.

“Conductive Wire” brings different qualities resolved in a continuous way: distance and closeness, ephemeral and lasting time, freedom and imprisonment, movement and static.

This is the eighth creation belonging to the "Memento Mori" series, through which I transform the passing rites of my birthdays into performance actions.
