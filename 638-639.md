In this action, we see reflections already evoked in procedural drawings, in sculptural objects and in previous performance works, with an uninterrupted thread that includes several visual constructions that present hybrid bodies in a queer perspective, whose expressions approach dance, sculpture and of clothing at once.
“Conductor Wire” brings different qualities resolved in a continuous way: distance and closeness, ephemeral and lasting time, freedom and imprisonment, movement and static.
This is the eighth creation belonging to the "Memento Mori" series, through which I transform the passing rites of my birthdays into performance actions.
