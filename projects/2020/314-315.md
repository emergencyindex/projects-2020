"Meet You Outside" is a performance for camera made under the conditions of my pregnancy and the isolation caused by the covid-19 pandemic. Interacting with a scanner resonates with the medical equipment used to monitor my pregnancy, the emotional dependency on technology while in isolation, home office, and the representation of the body when present bodies are not possible. Sitting on a couch I scan my body in parts starting from my feet going upwards, as much fits in a A4 size. I print all the scans in b&w representing my body in different angles but keeping a 1:1 scale. I attach the prints in the same scanning order with strong transparent tape making a very long stripe. From my window, located on the 5th floor of Kaapelitehdas building I let the body prints slowly roll out, gliding in all directions with the strong wind. Who ever might have been looking might have seen something like a rope, connecting the inside with the outside. 
This video performance was made as part of Confinamiento video-performance cycle, organized by Perfo-Red MX. It can be see in this link: https://vimeo.com/491641734
