On the first floor of the SIM gallery in Reykjavik, I would stand under a light funnel swaying back and forth. The funnel was closed around my neck, allowing no oxygen to enter or exit the funnel. I would whisper for my partner Paul to come to me, to be carried across the see and settle here in Iceland with me. Throughout the 2-hours, the performance lasted, the funnel would slowly implode, and condensation would run along the interior of the funnel, and the foil would stick against my face, changing the expression of the performance. The experience on the inside of the funnel was very different to the outside. The audience could see in, but I couldn't see out. I was trapped inside this bright and highly reflective space, with no visibility of the audiences.
"SUNSON" dealt with a long-distance relationship, physical and spiritual longing, as my partner and I was separated by the ocean between Ireland and Iceland, due to work commitments. This was the first time we had been apart in 2 years. It was performed shortly before lockdown, which we spent together in his cottage in Ireland. In September I returned to Iceland to start the Master of Fine Arts in Performing Arts at the Iceland University of Art, largely due to Paul's help in writing an amazing application. This has led us being apart for 7 months in March. But the performance succeeded. Paul and I will be moving in together in Reykjavik in March 2021.The power of love and art, changes everything and nothing is impossible. It'll make you lose your breath, but in the end it'll all be worth it. Please do not attempt to recreate this piece, due to the dangers of suffocation involved.
 
I love you more than words can say 
pour into me all day and beam you 
into being here with me till the day 
we both shall die I light 

Two-hour performance  
in pursuit of being here 

Dedicated to the love of my life - Paul Gibson 

Michael Richardt is a Danish performance artist, specialised in long durational performance. His practise is anchored in the physical body in relation to the movements of the planet's geophysical forces, such as torsion, propulsion, wave interference and iridescent hyper surface structures, and uses these in relation to ready-mades, sculptures, tasks, body and spacetime to create an alchemical transformation.
