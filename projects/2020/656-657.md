Marval A Rex functioned as a "live slippage" inside the DFBRL8R space wearing a performance remnant from a prior piece by a different artist, to conform to the rules of the exhibition curated by Ieke Trinks, titled "What Remains". The goal was to "reactivate" the performance relic. The relic or remnant in question was a pair of yellow panties with the word "art" written on them in black marker. Rex decided to put the underwear on using questionable methods. The ART UNDERWEAR, as it became, was fastened crudely and efficiently to Rex's body via safety pins by accomplice Vicente Ugartechea. Once the ART UNDERWEAR was affixed to the body, Ugartechea then fastened pink markers on pink strings to myriad points on Rex's body through the laborious piercing process. At this point, the audience was invited to "complete the work of art" by marking Rex's body with the pink markers that were attached to the body via safety pin, while Rex slowly conformed to art-historical poses (ie., contrapposto, adlocutio, serpentine). The piece itself explores the penetrative or "puncturing" quality of the audience's gaze, the perversion of the ideal male form, and ultimately a meta-reference to the power dynamics between audience and performer.
