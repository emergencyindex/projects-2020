This performance deals with perception issue, -s, distance and space inside museums. The context they provide always tends to alter the way we see art pieces. Thus, every museum visit forges new dynamics every time, emotionally and conceptual-wise. "The Short Life of A Long-lasting Picture" it's not a trick to attract visitors or to enhance museums' popularity, but an attempt of delve or prospect the context these specific spaces provide one way or another of perception. Displaying many works in one and the same *territory* recalls decisions and a certain intention of how the public *should* stand in front of the exhibited works. Besides aesthetic principles, there are often others accompanying them, politically and/or socially oriented. Hence, one could see several exhibitions comprising the same pieces in many different juxtapositions as instance *Animalia* before and after Darwin. When I started to think about this performance I thought about the shifting and deceptive relationships we have with images and exhibition spaces. "The Short Life of A Long-lasting Picture" is based on the exchange between regulated movements and improvisation determined by circumstances, public included.
