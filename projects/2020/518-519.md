In the wake of the presidential election in the USA, my troupe Legacy Fatale was invited to perform and march amongst a larger consort of acclaimed artists and activists in New York City gathering under the banners of the "Vote Feminist Parade" and the "Wide Awakes 2020" movements. 
Together assembled with our respective banners, costumes and signs, we raised awareness on social issues while encouraging everyone to vote. 
On this occasion, "The Urban Punk Amazons Vote" performance took place as a public participatory happening on Times Square were the participants gathered. Legacy Fatale members led the audience into a series of three signature movements demonstrating empowerment, interconnectivity and collective healing.
