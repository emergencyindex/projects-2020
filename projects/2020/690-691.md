We stood in front of two mirrors on opposite sides of the country. Then we called each other on a video chat platform. We turned our phones to face the mirror and began swinging our phones back and forth in a smooth motion for the effect of feeling like you are on a swing inside of your telephone. The performance is screen recorded. In the screen recording, we get the experience of sitting on a swing set together.
