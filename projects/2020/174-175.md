"Meat Package Product Dance" was a response to industrial agriculture in a consumer context. The performance is, in large part, a demonstration of the "Meat Package Product Quilt," and a way to explore consumer culture and materialism through performance. I made this quilt/performance prop from vinyl, cotton batting, yellow polyester fabric, and cotton fabric printed with images of ground meat. The quilt is an oversized package of ground meat, with a panel of gloves hidden in the middle. During the performance, myself and other performers gloved hands emerge from the quilt to dance and animate the product. As the performers are inside the "Meat Package Product Quilt," the performers and the prop merge into a strange hybrid prop-puppet-performer.
