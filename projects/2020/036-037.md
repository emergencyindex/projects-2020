If we are doing something, it will be really good for them?
This work idea came from this small think.
My answer is "We don't know till result"

I cut 7 small pieces of fabric from the big fabric(almost 10MX10M).
And I take out soils with a shovel from the holes(part of small pieces), put in pockets.
I put some junk near me in pockets(same pocket which I put soils).
After filling all pockets, I fix pockets on small holes.
The big fabric looks like before cutting.
I bring this big fabric to other places and display this.
On way, the big fabric was tornning and look very ugly.

See what I did!
