Living in a time and place, where identification with
the thin membrane of skin, as container of self, is slowly dissolving,
as borders between beings evaporate, the environment disintegrates into
a myriad of sentient beings. 
These sentiments was kept at the centre throughout the process, and raised questions about ethics and being as a parasite (since ”the vehicle” needs to consume other lifeforms to sustain being). 

The project became a daily practice, triggered by restricted movements of 2020.
To use the work as a platform to enter a dialogue with the non-human processes that surrounds me. I kept coming back to a sense of, the limits or lack of language at the core of this seeming resistance to integrate what I know.
Living in a retinal world where the word became authority,
how can the action contribute to an integration of knowledge, that bypass the limits of word based languages? Can this ”language of action” be its own authority, its own tool for exploring the subtle necessary changes we as species are facing?
