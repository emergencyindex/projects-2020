We have created a reality of my trans* fantasy using green screen, the fantastical trans* body, and augmented reality. Not only do we wish to subvert the meaning of the phallus, but also to understand how we can create one that is not destructive but rather constructive of a healthy, joyous, expressive reality full of potential fantasies. We want to use the media of augmented reality to create the fantasies that our trans* bodies may not be able to immediately access on their own. We want to satirize the power that the white penis has, using my trans* body and these new possible augmented realities as a starting place to do that. As a trans* masculine enby person, I perform a fantasy in reality, that is both attached and separate from the binary masculinity, but most importantly attempts to surpass such things. We created this work both as a way to extend ourselves outside of the reality of quarantine and the small living space we were forced to stay in through temporary displacement and as a way to connect to a healthy trans* fantasy that is disconnected from toxic penis.
