“MAMA” is a private live performance, performed at a home studio. I have locked myself with my two children in an empty room for three hours. I set the camera and pressed the record. I have been tirelessly repeating the same words “I want to be a good artist, I want to be a good mama” while kids were coping with a new setting and trying to interact with their mother. 
For the entire 3 hrs, I was repeating this one sentence over and over again. I measured the mother and children relationship to highlight the ambiguity of social values and the paradoxes of socio-political artist-mother status in the art world. 
Private performance. 3hrs. Total video performance time 3 hrs.
