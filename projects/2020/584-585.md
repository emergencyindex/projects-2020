My body holds great power when experiencing the Earth’s natural elements, feeling bigger and greater than what it is. Through performing “Together”, video, photographs and soft sculpture, I’ve executed this desire while placing my body in natural spaces around me. I explore these landscapes while dragging exaggerated soft sculpted hands to further explore the idea of being bigger. Identity and my experience as a feminine body is introduced throughout the performance as I entangle myself with the fabricated hands while exploring my own body.

Layering becomes an important part of this performance, combining movement, fabric and video, it provides a sense of connection through a sequential way of becoming whole. Each of these significant moments highlight true comfort and growth.
