“re_______” meditated on the intersections of identity, history, and place through an interactive online performance and zine presented via Zoom and USPS. The work aimed to return the physical to storytelling, archive, and record-making processes in a non-linear, non-narrative format. 
 
The process to create “re_______” started three years ago as I explored my relationship to Asian American identity and its often forgotten, misremembered, and intricate history. I found myself belatedly learning these stories as an immigrant turned citizen, both in and out of the narratives that frame the experiences of Asians in America. “re_______” was an attempt to acknowledge and understand the breadth and multiplicities that build the collage of Asian American experiences.
