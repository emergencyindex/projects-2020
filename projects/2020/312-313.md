The performance “Escalda Pés” proposes to share an active participation with the public, weaving through the touch an unraveling of sensations and building senses through the feet. A motto for relaxation and contact with ancient healing habits. Held at the virtual event MIZURA, its action plan unfolds as follows: sitting on a chair and around me all the objects to do the action (a sound ocean background, a basin, orange towels, two shells, a electric pitcher, a glass with cloves and cinnamon, coconut soap, a herb sprayer, a thermos with cold water) I wash my feet and tell about the perceptions I feel in the performance. In this event where the performance took place, I started to perform the action as an unfolding of concerns that still could not be said fully. In this proposition, I relate some approaches to the relational experience, proposing to the viewer to be participative in the work of art. In a world where art is only to be seen in its visuality, it breaks with this logic and points out other ways of receiving it. Thus, this reception by the body calls for participation through relational objects, moving them or passing them on the skin. These objects are extracted from everyday life: water, shells, towels; it is as if they were for the viewer's body, a kind of anthropophagy of creation. The process of washing your feet is related to daily relaxation and, because of that, there is a process of sharing the touch. Creating situations of bodily relaxation, derived from affective memories, comes the feeling of my grandmother washing my feet as a child. I share these actions of care and warmth with others. My grandmother provided me with that moment at night, before sleeping, and in this memory I establish a place of protection and affection. Using as an artistic action the resumption of memories that ask for passage, I enter a zone of comforts and kindnesses, which let the sensations in performance open a field for the sensitive processes. These actions update my grandmother. Within this childhood imagination, I can see her again, even after her death.
