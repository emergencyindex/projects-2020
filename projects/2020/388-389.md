THE NEW ARMOR
Mixed technique + Performance
(5 fiberglass rods, ORALITE GP 340
(Highlight - Imagine - Shadow) fluorescent lime yellow Reflexite © Brand Conspicuity Tape (tested acc. to: EN ISO 20471: 2013+A1, ANSI / ISEA 107-2015.
300 cm diameter, 942 cm circumference).


In response to the new needs arising from the worldwide spread of Covid-19, this proyect explores the difficulties in maintaining interpersonal physical distance in public spaces. As a result, she redeems the traditional 19th century crinoline, adjusting its structure to create “The New Armour”, a circular artifact which has a circumference of almost 10 metres, a diameter of 3 metres and a radius of 1.5 metres. Created with 35 metres of fibreglass bars and more than 70 metres of high visibility reflective tapes, the new armour offers a greater lightweight and flexibility. The performance consists of walking through the streets of the different neighborhoods of the city, wearing the new armor. The artistic action shows once more the social impact that art can have, acting as a means of information that can teach, in a graphic and universal way, the minimum safety distance that people should keep.
