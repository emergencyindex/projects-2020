In the performance "Corona World Test", I used a large number of white medical masks, which are now used to protect and defend against infection with the Covid 19 virus. I lined up the masks along the entire length of the SULUV gallery in Novi Sad (Serbia). Then I tied all the masks together with black and yellow warning self-adhesive tape, and a little for the gallery floor. I lay down on this snake-like floor installation, and glued the beginning in the middle of my body. Then I turned / rolled on the floor, and pulled, wrapped the bound medical masks around my body. On the back of the mask were copies of banknotes, coins of 100 dollars and 100 euros. The money could be seen by wrapping it around my body, now, only at the end of the performance. The current pandemic, which is likely to last for a very long time, is an ideal test for the individual, society, national and world economy, culture and life.
