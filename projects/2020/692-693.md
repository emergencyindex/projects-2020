During the holidays of Winter 2020, I began a meditative night practice at a closed parking lot. The vacant darkness of the lot is visible from the small balcony in front of my room. I began to engage with the darkness by throwing the string from my room to the lot, over the fence. The process was intuitive and simple. I untied the bundle of lights with slow walking to create a drawing, often tracing English and Korean words. Sometimes the drawing was just one word or from the middle of a sentence or an incomplete word. All of the letterforms come from my diary and a list of words I’ve heard from roommates, close friends, and in virtual meetings that I’ve been interacting with. This ongoing performance culminated in a video titled, “A nonchalant vacation". Through making and sharing this work, I’m seeking reconnection in everyday places where *retraining* could be a means of care for the body.

This concept of reconnection has become important to me after living in five different places since I came to Los Angeles to study art in summer of 2019. I finally settled in my apartment during the pandemic in August. Through all of my moves and weaving between different spaces and times, I’ve gradually realized my *trained* negligence to the laborious actions I engage my body with. I have been encountering habituated guilt from the thought that my endeavors are not enough to prove my value in society. These realizations and Covid-19 sparked isolation pushed me into a corner, but through this performance I was able to reflect solely on myself. 

Expectation, passion, art-making, friends, home, survival, productivity, woman, success, isolation, bewilderment, disoriented, and imperfection.
