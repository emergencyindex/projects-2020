Performed for the first time during the Pandemic period, curated by Isa Sanz, Territori Performance art festival in Ibiza, Spain. "Human Typer" took place in the Unesco site of Alt Vila. I performed in a live-stream and for people passing by. As Dalt Vila in September 2020 was in lockdown. 
My idea is to communicate through body movements and to slow down the fast pace of the capitalistic and consumeristic society.
Each letter printed was an act of care, a new dimension itself before even a word is formulated, each letter witness effort and intention, the process matters as the journey of our lives and not only the aim or goals.
In "Human Typer", I was wearing an outfit holding 26 letters stamps of the alphabet onto different parts of my body. 
During the performance, I communicated to the audience my thoughts in fragmented words, my concerns about the world through a fragmented poetic text, enhanced by the body movement and the act of printing each letter with a different part of my body. each word became part of the text printed on a 300x200cm panel. The project explores the digitalization of human being and the humanization of the digital world; Enslaved by technology, Itâ€™s time that human being takes the lead of the world, returning to the natural pace of nature. Typing each letter is physically engaging at the contrary of the pace our society that takes fast communication for granted. In the human typer is highlighted the importance of communication but also going through the difficult journey to fully express our inner worlds, taking our time to do so, within our full understanding. A technology applied to the human that instead of making it faster it makes it slower. The human typer needs to slow down as communication can be too fast to be grasped and the consciousness of communicating can be increased by making an effort for each letter the human typer, types. Each letter is a piece of communication and it was printed through constrained movements and physical engagement making the human typer in a visceral touch with communication.
