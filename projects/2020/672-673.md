Trees are living time capsules of land. They are witnesses of history. They witness climate changes, migration, colonization, industrialization, and urbanization. They live long enough to witness the long history of displacement and discrimination, as well as the forgotten massacre and killing that took place under their shades. Outlive human lifespan, they are the evidence of the Anthropocene. They are the nonhuman others among the others. 

"Witness of Land" is a performance project by Hings Lim that maneuvers augmented reality (AR) technology to bring forth the presence of witness trees. Upon the arboreal survivor and landmark in a neighborhood, the performances summon the absence of the past. The incantations are performed to conjure the memories of land while recalling the human history that still haunts.
