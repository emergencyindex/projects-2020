This performance is titled "PIA" and continues my ongoing *Timon of Athens* project.  In particular, I am developing works dedicated to the character of Merchant from the play.  "PIA" is a 6-minute drawing performance where I wear an exaggerated paper machè mask of myself as I create a circular artwork on the wall of the THE END Project Space in Atlanta, GA.  I made marks using contè and painted cardboard letterforms while my collaborator added footprints.  The performance includes an original audio recording of me reciting lines from Pia Zadora's interview in the October 1983 issue of *Penthouse* magazine.  This work uses the historical events surrounding Pia Zadora as a prompt to expand my range in both drawing and performance and to locate my practice more securely at the edges of the canon.
