I performed *Learn Baby Sign Language* as part of Hotel Dada Fluxfest Online 2020, a live stream event organized by the HOTEL DADA Gallery Base de Arte Correo y Poes√≠a Experimental (directed by Argentinian artists Silvio De Gracia and Ana Montenegro). The event was curated by Mexican American artist Bibiana Padilla Maltos. 

Fluxfests, gatherings of international artists who are inspired by the Fluxus art movement, have been held in American and Canadian cities since 2009. Usually, over the course of the festivals artists perform original and historic scores at events in several venues. The Hotel Dada Fluxfest was the first Fluxfest held completely in virtual space. It was live streamed August 1 and 2 on the Jitsi platform. 40 artists were each allotted approximately 3 minutes to perform.

I was challenged to engage the audience, the other performers, with a short, interactive performance that was interesting no matter what language you spoke. I wanted to use the distortions created by the laptop camera as part of my performance. The idea of demonstrating baby sign language seemed ideal. 
I could move my hands close to the camera, so they appeared huge. The audience could copy the hand signs. It was simple and in the spirit of Fluxus. 
Baby sign language is a set of hand gestures taught to babies to help them communicate before they learn to speak. Some of the signs are the same as American Sign language. 

I wore white and had a white background so my hands would stand out. People did follow and repeat the hand signs. 

Here is the Score for my performance:

Mimic a baby crying. Say WAH, WAH, WAH. 3 times. 
Say LEARN BABY SIGN LANGUAGE
Repeat each word 3 times (except where noted) while making the baby sign for the word with your hands
