Troubled by the muted actions and the
amplification of seemingly resonant but ultimately meaningless language transmitted by the UK government during the pandemic, *StayInAlert* was a means for me to both personally circumvent the isolation of lock-down and in my absence from others it became a wish to cultivate and give agency to their collaboration and participation offline. Exposing and undermining the inconsistent and confusing messages of national guidance and the nebulous instructions of behavioral change, the work developed from a script over time, incorporating the now ubiquitous Lato font
and borrowing from the design and propagation of public information resources to become first a script and slideshow, then an audio work, and now a video.

Aware that my practice had shifted to working alone at home again and engaging
with more activities based on and at a screen and what is experienced through it, I was delighted when after seeing a draft of my script Anne Bean invited me in July to contribute to *Come Hell Or High Water*; a monthly performance event on the foreshore near the end of Three Colt Street, London. Keen for others to see my video while also responding to and poking fun at both government guidance and the public's now weary apathy I devised a "Socially Distanced Performance." Dressed in black, wearing a face covering, and using a grabber hand with which to keep a minimum safe distance, for several hours I attempted to distribute flyers to the public on the busy street above the foreshore. For the most part avoided, although occasionally succeeding; myself, the performance, flyers, and video were met with a mixture of awkward disdain, embarrassment and uncomfortable laughter with many of the public unsure if what I was doing was official and/or if touching the flyers or opening their mouths to speak was either a good idea or not. Once all the flyers were exhausted the performance was concluded.
