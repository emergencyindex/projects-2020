"Artemisia Negra" is a series of ritual performances and anointments addressing the interconnectivity between human and plant subjects. Specifically, "Artemisia Negra" introduces an invasive species in New York State called artemisia vulgaris (mugwort) by anointing audience participants via smudging them with smoke from a large mugwort wand, consensual whipping with leafy mugwort branches and ending with an invitation to ingest mugwort tea. The image shown is from a performance in August, 2020 at the Plaxall Gallery during the pandemic of COVID-19. I was invited to do a ritual opening for the night’s performances. In lieu of whipping audience members with plant material, I cracked a bullwhip, using the sound of the crack to split the air and make way for the events to follow. I often use the sonic force of a whip ritualistically as to psychically purify and clear a space.
