A line was traced with a chalk marker pen along the left handrail of an electric escalator located within Mexico City Metro Station Aquiles Serdán in the direction of Barranca del Muerto, following the escalator's own course of travel while remaining in a fixed position on the ground floor beside the escalator, until an uninterrupted and continuous line was formed.
