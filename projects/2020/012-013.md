"Uncertain Journeys" is a co body-based performance that draws on Chinese Kung Fu and yogic shamanism. I developed this work during the Covid-19 pandemic as it was impractical to travel to perform this work live. The work was created as a way to look into the tropes of oriental mysticism in which the body is placed within a precarious and possibly dangerous situation such as surrounded by hot coals, on beds of nails, and the like but the performer uses the mind and a focused concentration can navigate this terrain. However, more importantly the work is about walking in circles, seemingly getting nowhere and the dangers inherent to living in our current climate of dangerous health situation, violent and unjust politics, and strained social relations. This work is a piece that looks inward. The actions required great mental focus and meditation, so it is a performance that says, even walking in circles, and not really getting anywhere, is still a great vehicle for advancing oneself.
