Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the official time standard that airports, stock markets, and wireless communications rely on, is anything but absolute. Derived from 82 master atomic clocks around the world, UTC relies on collected asynchronous data that is relayed to the International Bureau for Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Paris for reckoning, eventually producing the world’s most accurate clock, a monthly report known as the *Circular T*.

Containing a blend of original text and information derived from BIPM’s official time standard reports, DiCarlo in a performative-lecture style from "Circular T: A Collection of Uncertainties," an experimental work exploring a spectrum of anomalous temporal phenomena such as geologist Michel Siffre’s discovery of circadian rhythms during his isolation experiments; philosopher William James’s measurement of the moment in what he termed the “specious present;” psychologist Sylvie Drout-Volet’s research on empathetic embodiment in relation to aging populations; and neuroscientist David Eagleman’s exploration into the “oddball effect,” a phenomenon where unexpected events perceptually stretch time. Each poetic fragment in this collection acts as a discordant data point set against an assumed universalized standard.
