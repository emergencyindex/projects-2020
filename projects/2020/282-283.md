„Cuerpo-Anticuerpo“ (Body-Antibody) was created for the 2nd phase of the video performance cycle #confinamento (confinement), held by the performance platform perfoREDmx as an online festival.
 
The first image is of one of the busiest city avenues with unusual low traffic seen from above a rooftop-terrace. Then a hand comes into the field of vision with a Corona-beer bottle and you can read clearly: “Corona Extra - the finest beer”. I walk into the area where the camera is recording -the beer in my hand- and start pouring the beer over my head, bending slightly over, a gesture as if I’m washing my hair. With one hand I’m pouring the beer, with the other I’m craping my scalp, distributing the beer evenly. When the bottle is empty, I take my glasses off and perform head banging movements, shaking off the excess beer. Then I grab an electric hair trimmer from the floor, switch it on, and cut my beer soaked front hair with six strokes. I shake the excess hair off the trimmer and hold it straight into the camera. The image freezes, and a second view onto the semi-busy avenue fades in. This time with a lego-crocodile mounted in first plane. It looks as if all the cars on the street sort of come straight out of its open mouth. The closing scene consist in me emptying another Corona-beer over the toy crocodile and leave it dripping. Altogether, the video is 1:40 min long.
 
With this piece, I voice my existential necessity to belief in a cure, a protection form the virus, from the pandemic of 2020. The golden glowing Corona-beer stands at the same time for an immunity-giving liquid in a bathing ritual and as a weapon to curse the virus, personified as a toy lego-crocodile. 
We are body-based beings and the pandemic has hit us rock-bottom with our utter dependency on a healthy body. In Covid-19 times, having antibodies is a matter of survival. But at the same time the word itself makes me wonder about a contradictory double-meaning: the positively associated medical antibody and the theoretical concept of a non-existing body. Body-Antibody in the sense of Matter-Antimatter. Thus, I’m left with the question of all questions: Where and what is the antibody of the performance-body?
