THE BODY AS A LANDSCAPE FOR HOLDING, RECREATING, AND RELEASING TRAUMA. MOVEMENT, VOICE, TOUCH, CONSUMPTION, TRANSFORMATION, DREAMS. COPING WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BECOMES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WHEN WE ARE FORCED TO CONTINUE ON RELENTLESSLY WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF CAPITALISM.

I performed this for the camera. I put on my makeup, tell a story that I dreamt, then recite anti-capitalists mantras of self love. Throughout it all, I am dancing, drinking, and screaming.
