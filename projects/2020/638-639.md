A pié,
		there is no beginning or ending for walking
other than my functioning legs. ugh

i went into 2020 on foot, a taught practice, a lesson on how to conocer, meet a place.
a year began dancing around and stepping into a fire with people i never met.

i did not arrive walking but wished i had, imagined a spiraling carnaval making its way south on the Abya Yala eastern coast from Lenape land to rest on Muisca territory 
like a bus at a stop, not a destination but for currents to coincide, corriente, running

mostly meditative, any moment with less aim stolen from pressed counting.
it is persistent, la acción de caminar juntes, organized we become relentless, liquid
blocking avenues, preventing further rush or absorbing and feeding the excitement of encounter
marchamos

quizás maybe, making a date a hashedtag jarrs enough to establish another rhythm. overlaying again, over gregorian calendars, over nationalized religious settler holidays
21 every month
21O 21N 21D 21E 21F 21M 21A 21M 21J 21J 21A 21S
cada día
someone is out, on the street, with banners, with songs to pierce clockedwork
can we feel cycles undefined
aunque nadie convoque

remember feeling this year, as if i had walked the planet over twice, passing most of it with my eyes closed almost. looking down willing my knees to carry on. ow
como quienes caminan
desplazades 
motivades
perdides
quienes pasean o buscan

what is the performance? every intentional step in public.
each rehearsal indoors recorded videos no one but i watch. bailes i do not yet dare to share. next year we train outside too
afuera, ensayamos y damos y duele

surely you wonder, i do not claim collective action. i only take responsibility for its presentation here. 

A pié is not allinclusive. it is only the eyear on the ground i used among so many. many march on wheels or even from home. o tell stories of nonbinary travel
only the spectacular shadow to justice and care. hurts

the foto was taken 21N 2020. A strange echo of the effervescent 21N 2019. 
A small group, queer and trans, gathered to paint a tarp, to represent us amid the multiple collectives and parties that march in horizontal and spontaneous movement on continuous if inconsistent flows. 
here and everywhere

i painted the words scraping mano contra ladrillo, ouchito
walked again 25N with DDHH FEMINISTA vest
