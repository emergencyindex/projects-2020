As we are in isolation times, a lot of performance festival happenned on web spaces. This one I enjoyed was developed by an Indian collective, Hexxyduxxybox, based in Dehli, as we perform from our places.
In these times, I was in my partners house, working in a tiny space. Thinking in ways to be protected from virus and all the political problems that came with this crisis in Brazil. So I made an action in tiny movements, building small sculpture pieces and putting then on my body, making a dance of them with my breath. So the pieces are in and out, sometimes they fall, other they stay dancing with the artists breathing, with no expectancy or climax.
