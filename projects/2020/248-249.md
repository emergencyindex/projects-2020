How much more control are we going to allow over our bodies?
Weâ€™re already watched over and controlled by the institutions of power. That same control defines us as living bodies. We resist by staying alive. But we also resist by trying to have greater sovereignty over a territory that feels less our own, day after day. My resistance means managing my own life, my ways. My resistance is to be permanently transitioning, questioning all impositions, sharing and giving myself, and also receiving.
Menstruating throughout the house, allowing it to take over my life and context, allowed me to inhabit in a different way. Making it public is also a part of my resistance.

During strict lockdown in Argentina, I chose to menstruate throughout my house, the only space I could inhabit with some freedom. I didn't hold back the blood, staining my clothes, furniture, and floor. I became one with my surroundings as I covered everything as much as possible with the blood that came out of me.
