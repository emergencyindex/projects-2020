Several 3’ x 6’ x ¼” sheets of tempered glass were dropped from a mechanical lift above my head. As they fell at my feet, I mimicked the action of a cannon ball. Tempered glass shatters at Mach 4, so in human-based time, this performative act ends in 5 seconds. The aftermath shows me moving aside and slowly washing my feet—picking out bloody glass fragments from my legs and toes. 

While I am washing my feet, a high-speed camera projects onto the seamless behind me and plays back the footage at 12,000 frames per second. It stretches the moment into eight minutes of splashing. As the audience, you have seen and experienced everything that is being projected, but at this play back speed, you are allowed to bask in motion and physics. As the glass falls past my body, it distorts and warps my face, neck, torso, and then finally legs. The splintering glass looks harmless as it collides with the ground and my body. The suspended shards hang in the air with aimless purpose. 

At the end of eight minutes, the video loops, but I hobble away, and you are allowed to stay in augmented time or return to reality.
