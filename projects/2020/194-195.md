"STAY SANE" is a drive-in performance in response to current stay-at-home orders and a ceremony for the death of live performances within the proscenium. I was inspired by guerilla-style performance, drive-in movie theatres, and processionals. Guests are sent an invitation via text message, encouraged to socially distance themselves by remaining in their vehicle, and could invite people within their recent contact pool to join them. Once guests arrive, the performance begins with myself leading a procession to another destination on foot where the actual performance will take place. Music is played through the speakers of the leading car and video documented from that perspective. The entire experience lasts a duration of twenty minutes for discretion and a short break from the anxieties that came with adjusting to quarantine.
