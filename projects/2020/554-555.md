Mother Scapegoat is part of my ongoing series SCAPEGOATS (2013-Present) a meditative and poetic sculptural exploration of the indoctrination into societal othering as a form of devoted practice. In it, the deity is the Scapegoat, a figurative representation of blame and shame as internalized acts and subconscious thought processes that sacrifice individuals within a community for their queer existences. In Mother Scapegoat the deity is shown relaxed in a safe environment that re-envisions a triumphant ending for the social castaways.
