My "Quitter" performance uses bondage imagery to evoke subjects that relate to sexualization and submission. I stayed tied in one position for an hour while I continuously spit into a funnel that led to a condom. With no water to aid in the production of my saliva, I had to continuously focus on producing more, only in order to spit it out and hopefully land in the funnel, many times with no luck. The continuous fight between producing more saliva and immediately discharging it from the body stirs up feelings of submission and servitude. Finally, I was released from my restraints and proceeded to drink the saliva that had collected in the bottom of the condom. While this act clearly references the obedient, sexual act of swallowing a partners seminal fluid, it is juxtaposed with the fact that it is my own fluid that I am consuming, thus complicating the submissive relationship between myself, the artist, and the viewer. "Quitter" also deals with the sexual roles of partners, especially in relation to gender, and the expected acts and outcomes that accompany it.
