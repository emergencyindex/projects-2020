"Where Are You Darling?"

*Two artists and lovers braided each other’s hair for sixteen hours plus one final hour open for public. After some time passed, they walked from different ends of the Chinese Great Wall to meet in the middle, break up and split ways forever. 
I am in China now. Tethered to the white horse, I bow to the endless steppes of Inner Mongolia.
What am I doing here?
Where do I come from? 
Where are you my darling?*

It was a short action that could be captured in a single photo, created on a Mongolian grassland in an extremely low temperature of -27 ° C thanks to the help of local artists and the audience who helped me negotiate with the horse breeder and minimize the risk. 

Two months after the performance one of the artists I thought about during this action, died.
