From the performance Taped (1975) by Jill Scott, in which she is affixed with tapes to the wall of a museum, here we have a man affixing a body to the floor. Only one hand remains, which through its red-painted nails, we can identify as being of a woman. The idea is to bring to the public space the debate about the various violence against women, opening up this voluntary / involuntary scorn that we have seen in relation to the growing wave of aggressions and deaths of women. Therefore, the choice of two squares with a large circulation of people, one in the upper part of the city and inside the University of Coimbra (Praça Dom Dinis) and the other in downtown (Praça 8 de maio), both in Coimbra-Portugal.This performance is part of a series of actions that discuss the issue of gender violence called ‘crueza’.
