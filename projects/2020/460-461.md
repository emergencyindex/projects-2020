*continuance* is dystopian dramatic cycle, spanning three generations. A man and a girl, a mother and a son, a son and a girl - all desperate for something like eternity amid a decaying world, gasping for hope while struggling to breathe, and forever stuck in the patterns of the past. A cyclical exploration of civil war, legacy, and the memory of trauma, *continuance* is a direct response to a reality besieged by ever more catastrophic crises, an increasingly destabilized political landscape, and a deteriorating environment. The repetition of text across three generations highlights our culture's refusal to break with the patterns of the past to ensure a future for humanity.
