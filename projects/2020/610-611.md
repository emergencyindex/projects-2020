' Raspado ' 
Using a raspador, a tool used to make Raspados (Mexican style snow cones), I scrape away at a 50lb block of ice for the duration of 3.5hrs. This is my literal translation of abolishing ICE, the system that has affected many Latinx communities. This piece was performed as a response to the inhumane actions Immigration and Customs Enforcement has carried out on people, especially children. 

The 3.5 hour durational piece was performed outside of a cemetery in Los Angeles in a residential area and was viewed by multiple surrounding residents. Because of the pandemic a formal live performance gathering could not be executed and so the piece was compressed down and composed into a 5 minute video work.
