"RARA" is a live streamed real time motion capture performance featuring a lone cheerleader who perpetually hypes herself forward through looping stadiums in a dystopian future where football as we know it has collapsed. Looking at the rise of sports entertainment throughout the 20th century, "RARA" builds upon the particular forms of storytelling embedded within the game of football. Tumbling narratives of achievement, redemption, progress and the unknowns of improvisation, chance, and limitation. Inspired by the cultural crockpot of stadiums, mascots, chips and dips that fuse into a slurry of capitalistic machismo, "RARA" delves into the aesthetics of audience allegiance, superstition, hope, and cultural value. RARA playfully speculates on a reimagined future of sport and competative entertainment through live digital performance and a keen eye on the rhetoric of motivation.
