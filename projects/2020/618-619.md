"THE WATER TANK SESSIONS", curated by Verónica Peña, is a new series of long-distance audio-visual collaborations that invites professional musicians, singers, and sound artists to play while being inspired by the submerged body.

For the first enactment, sound artist Tara Gladden, and underwater performance artist Verónica Peña, collaborate live from different states of the U.S. Hosted by Grace Exhibition Space, NYC, the artists use an online platform to present the audience with a unique live audio-visual experience that combines respirations and hypnotic sounds with the enchanting vision of the suspended body.

"THE WATER TANK SESSIONS" wants to foster collaboration among artists in order to promote joy, togetherness, and creativity from our homes. By bringing artists together, and generating distinct audiovisual experiences for the audience, the project wants to help palliate the solitude, sadness, and hard daily circumstances created by the pandemic.
