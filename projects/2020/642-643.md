 My performance was a representation of what I currently feel as an immigrant in this country. I have always called this land my home, yet I live with the feeling I do not belong. My performance started from the moment I put on my clothes. A white tank top and white leggings, on them red marks, words of stereotypes, racial profanity, and ethnic slurs, used to hatefully describe undocumented Mexican-Americans. I then walked into the cornfield behind my house. I dug, I pushed and kicked the wet cold mud around to lay down in. I slowly began piling the mud starting from my feet and all the way up my body until I was completely buried in it. I buried myself just as I have felt forced to bury my identity in this country.  This act was symbolic of the everyday need to conceal my identity in my surroundings in this country especially given the current political climate. The struggle of an undocumented person to overcome. Just as many undocumented immigrants like myself feel it’s necessary to conceal their status. While I lay surrounded by the mud, corn husks, and wide-open field for a total of seven minutes, I didn’t feel the need to assimilate because I felt accepted by the land.
