In 2020, I documented myself falling asleep on nights I couldn’t. These documentations became a series of archived performance films called “Falling Asleep”.

In each performance, voicemails were played for the first time, impromptu one-sided digitised conversations received through the year from strangers with whom I shared intimate sensual public interactions. “Chronophilia with a stranger” engages in ideas of youth sexuality and detachment towards relationships that exist only briefly, nonphysically, or imaginatively. Drifting in six thousand black plastic spoons, I hope to suggest a form of materialising the intrinsic process of falling asleep, analogous to catharsis with a stranger.
