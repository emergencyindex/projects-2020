"Rite of Passage" is a intermediate time, the corporeity of the rites, the regurgitation of the "Old" and the annunciation of the "New" before the impermanence of the BEING in this world. Generating lives in the continuous exercise of making way for my peers to follow...a performation of the body anchored in the practices of collective affections and comforts, producing bodies of struggles, after all, where there is oppression there will be resistance and ours is made of the joining of spells and enchantments of our ancestors.
