The purpose of this Beatriz Albuquerque performance is to explore the notions of revolution and the upcoming evolution while creating a manifesto to emancipate ourselves from the oppression that we live daily. This performance points to the problem of still not having equality across gender, race, disability and intersectionality as well as acceptance of our differences. Scored and staged like a street demonstration, Beatriz uses a megaphone in this performance to entice others to join the good fight for equality and tolerance in the face of brutality and injustice.
