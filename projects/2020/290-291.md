During periods of health crisis such as COVID-19, the risks of domestic violence and exploitation against women and girls increases due to tensions at home, and the uncertainty generated in families by the decrease of income, as well as coexistence for time dragged on.  In addition, women and girl’s victims of domestic violence, face additional obstacles in fleeing risky situations or in accessing protection mechanisms and / or essential services that can save their lives, due to factors such as movement restrictions or quarantine. 

This video performance denounces the very starting point of domestic violence, It all starts with a word, one degrading word! vulnerable women are often the receptors of this abuse, it’s a fact that women have less resources to defend themselves because the economic systems allowed men to get paid greater than women, and therefore there is less access to education and resources.

The performance consists of sewing insulting words with a red thread on a rice paper mask the artist wears the masks until she can’t breathe no more, suffocating herself as an action of courage for all the women who can’t breathe! 

This performance piece pretends to be an action of liberation for the artist and also to liberate other women that had been emotionally abuse or verbal abuse.
