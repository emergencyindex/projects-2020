"Walker there are no butts, butts are thrown while walking” is an installation, video-performance and process art piece, designed and developed in the city of Madrid that seeks to generate a critical reflection on the environmental consequences of our daily actions. Thus, the work responds to the need to give visibility to the ecological impact of individual action in the public space. Consequently, the work consists of collecting and moving a large quantity of cigarette butts, thrown (un)consciously by people on the different roads of the urban center. In this way, the waste I found was creatively relocated, building a bridge that juxtaposes reality and representation, not to imitate or reject one or the other, but to reveal a message. In the documentation, alternatives of communication are explored, confronting and exposing the concerns to the public eye with crude and altered perspectives of what we live. Freedom means developing autonomy, personal and collective, that takes into account the concrete, social and natural world in which we live.
