On 1st December 2020, cultural events and cultural premises closed under the anti-coronavirus Czech governmental measures still were banned.   So the "Black Passenger" set out and tried to bring a small visual experience to the Prague public outside the virtual world.
He sent information about action on Instagram and then he used own made “smartmask” with specific video from author videorecords during antecedent travelling and experiences. He took Prague Public Transport:
… started at the tram stop Staroměstská after 14:28 by no. 17 …
… switched to tram no. 22 at the National Theatre...
... waited for No. 12 in Klárov ...
… passed Letná and boarded tram no. 26 on Strossmayerovo náměstí ...
… drove to Náměstí Republiky and used the metro line B ...
… reached one of the art centres – Pragovka at metro station Kolbenova ...

Then on 3rd December part of cultural places were open for three weeks, so “Black Passenger” will have to activate and go around his route in 2021 as well.
