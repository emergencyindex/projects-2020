This performance is part of a project researching the after-life of human made materials related to domesticity. The performance, in a storefront gallery takes the form of an otherworldly dry cleaner shop, composed of thousands of clear polyethylene dry cleaning bags. Four performers, including myself, activate the storefront windows as Sisyphean cleaning clerks. Dressed entirely in plastic, gloved, masked and wearing goggles the clerks perpetually sanitize, fold and sort thousands of plastic dry cleaning bags.
 One of the least clean way of cleaning is called dry cleaning. With a mixture of carcinogenic chemicals and an abundance of ghostly plastic bags, dry cleaning is the ultimate un-clean. Like the living dead, dry-cleaning generates a dead zone in the natural world, lingering long past its time.
