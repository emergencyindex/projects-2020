BURNED RADAR (RADAR QUEIMADAS)

This public art performance is a direct response to the current crime against humanity happening in the Amazon Rain forest committed by corporations and the Brazilian government. The durational performance presented by AnarkoArtLab involves two artists, Adriana Varella and Amy Gillian Wilson, ritualistically dragging a burnt and smoking tree throughout New York City. Are we all responsible for this? Are we seeking a parallel world? Can we even imagine what a solution could be? How we can all solve this together will be suggested in the end of the performance.
