What is reality and what is truth? 
In September 2020 I began filming seismic, an art film amplifying self-determination and the authentic voice of lived experience through the lens of 2020. The work has expanded to include the hyperreal version of the persona “Ventiko” who documents life including history (voting in the Presidential election 2020, the celebrations in Time Square of the Biden/Harris win, the inauguration etc.) while in her costume of a long black dress, blue surgical mask, glasses, Sunday hat and a GoPro. Persona and identity are explored through a combination of staged scenes and real life experiences, almost all occurring in the public sphere. Performing for the camera is a constant in all of our lives. seismic investigates the authentic truth of the day to day, cornering fabricated realities on social media and in the news through. This still is from the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade which was fabricated for television this year. Can we shift the focus to truth or will it all just fade away?
The project is ongoing.
