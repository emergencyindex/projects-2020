“My Husband” is the pseudonym and collective practice of Annika Berry & Eliza Doyle (2015–current). My Husband’s works are a series of slippages between author and subject, investigating methods of collaboration, modes of autonomy, and acts of embodiment. 

*the craziest year of my life I mean ours* is a zoom performance that took place in the digital and psychological space of the first rung of a ladder leading out of an underground survival bunker. The female character performing this work stopped to reflect on her time sub-surface, and her conscious efforts to become useful and invest herself in essential — though possibly misguided — forms of production. 

The performer herself was a digital composite, a generated persona whose likeness was drawn from an AI face generator producing an average white American woman. This character spoke directly to her audience for twelve minutes. She had spent much of her life preparing for an emergency very different from the one she now found herself inhabiting. She reflected on her pre-scripted expectations for disaster versus the reality of crisis, and admitted experiencing vertigo while climbing the ladder. She expressed a hesitance and simultaneous exuberance at the prospect of emerging into an uncertain future.
