Stills from the ASMR Mukbang performance through the desktop and mobile device. The artist is eating Pad Thai while chatting with viewers live, then blending the food with white bleach to make a “fusion” Pad Thai.

This ASMR Mukbang performance occurred during the event “Platform: Engaging the Ethics of Production and Consumption” at Santa Fe Art Institute, Santa Fe, NM.

From their press release:

“Performer May Maylisa Cat replicates the act of meditative consumption by a livestream ASMR Mukbang performance blending virtual and real-time audience engagements that challenges the fantasy of globalism and playfully undermine capitalism’s problematic production, food conviviality, and the consumption of the cultural “Other.”’
