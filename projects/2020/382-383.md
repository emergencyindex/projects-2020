According to the Atlas of Violence 2020, a woman is murdered in Brazil every two hours.
Every 6 hours and 23 minutes, a woman is killed inside a house.
Black women are almost twice as many victims as non-black women.
Every four minutes a woman is assaulted in Brazil.
According to data from Brazilian Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights (MMDH), violence against women in Brazil increased by 40% during the pandemic of the new corona virus, making the home environment one of the most dangerous for women.
This video-performance was made during the period of social isolation imposed due to the pandemic of the new corona virus. For 31 minutes, in this work I recall my own experiences of domestic violence lived to reflect violence against women, especially in the context where the domestic environment becomes the most dangerous and scary for many women.
In August I celebrate. I was born on the 30th, but it was on the 15th of August 2011 that I left my abuser's house, never to return, so thatâ€™s why August was the month chosen to not be silenced anymore.
For each day, at least one-woman victim of abuse or feminicide is remembered in this video-performance.
While sounds of heartbeats are interrupted by gunshots in the background, I paint my lips with red lipstick, which will later be used to remove from the calendar on the wall behind me the name of a woman who was murdered that day.
