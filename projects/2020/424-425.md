Given the circumstances of the healthy distance caused by the COVID pandemic, with the intention of dancing and making the few passersby dance in the street and intervene in a performative way in the little crowded public space, the contingent collective La Sorora Dinamita (variation of the famous group of Colombian-Mexican cumbia La Sonora Dinamita, famous in much of Latin America). 

The purpose of the contingent collective La Sorora Dinamita is to make the concept of sisterhood (sororidad) known to non-academic people or people in contact with feminisms and, at the same time, generate a reflection within the academy and feminist groups about it concept.

Pinina Flandes (Yecid Calderón) and Juan Fernando Mena intervene on the balcony of their apartment in order to turn it into a stage from which to perform lipsync of some famous Colombian cumbias loved by Mexicans. In the intervals between the 7 selected cumbias, audios are heard, voices of Latin American women living in different parts of the world, in which they address their notion of sisterhood. Pinina takes advantage of the microphone and on a couple of occasions she invites people on the street to dance and to know what sisterhood is, a concept unknown to non-academic or educated people.
