GRAFT
PERFORMANCE / SCULPTURE

BERLIN WALL
BERLIN-GERMANY 2020


THE PERFORMANCE CONSISTED TO BE ONE WITH A WALL.
I INSERTED MY FIST RAISED IN A HOLE FOUND IN THE WALL, PROTECTED BY CULTURAL HERITAGE, WHICH I FILLED WITH CEMENT AND I KEPT MY FIST RAISED UNTIL THE CEMENT DRIED, THEN TO BE REMOVED WITH CHISEL AND HAMMER AND LEAVE THE HOLE ON THE WALL.

I QUESTION THE SYMBOLS OF POWER THE IDEA OF A WALL AS AN INTRASPASABLE BARRIER.
