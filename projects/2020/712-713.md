The documentation of a tattoo on her leg, a thinly traced garter belt that reminds us of VALIE EXPORT, is also part of the exhibition [“Little Princess of the Cerrado” at CAAA Centre for Art and Architecture Affairs in Guimarães, Portugal]. VALIE EXPORT investigated the production of images, exploring her own body as an artistic instrument. Hilda de Paulo told me, during one of our conversations regarding reperformance concepts, that art critic Marvin Carlson said that EXPORT developed “an approach to performance called ‘feminist action’, which pursued a similarly fractured agenda, ‘seeking to substitute the equation *material = body = nature for body = social construct = transfigured nature*’” [1].
In “Hilda de Paulo (After VALIE EXPORT)” (2020), the artist mobilizes a sign associated with an universe historically and culturally constructed as feminine, embedding it into her own skin, and updating the performance as transfeminist. The tattooed garter belt takes on meanings of seduction and of oppression, in a tense game where hetero-cis-normative codes are challenged, expanding the meanings of womanhood. The socially constructed body, as a fixation, is the expressive dimension of this work, which is part of an ongoing series titled “Hilda de Paulo” (2020-).

[1] CARLSON, M. *Performance: Uma Introdução Crítica*. Belo Horizonte: UFMG, 2010, p. 189. Freely translated by Julia Lima from the original: “uma abordagem da performance chamada de ‘ação feminista’, que perseguia uma agenda fraturada similar, ‘procurando substituir a equação *material = corpo = natureza, por corpo = construção social = natureza transfigurada*’”.
