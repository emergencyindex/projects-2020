Every time I tell myself about the existence of a body, I move to a remote beginning. From the void, how does a movement start? I put attention and go linearly through the senses. I identify the first existence with the need for air: Inflate the chest. I feel the force of this presence spreading through an axis - which finds the ground and culminates in the celestial sphere. Seen the gesture that, regardless of the movement of the hands, brings with it the possibility of manifestation. In durational action, I am willing to keep seven swords for OGUM (this is a plant which the same name as the orisha) standing and with a forge effort, I understand that the trajectories of balance always have the center in common - which in strength is gravity and in direction, "Nadir" (video performance realized for the festival "LatidoAmericano, corpographies in context")
