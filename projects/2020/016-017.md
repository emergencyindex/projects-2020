It is not easy to stop fighting, to stop our human history of 10,000+ nonstop years of war. Despite the odds, I am determined to help achieve peace on earth.

I will flesh out my vision of a peaceful interconnected world with a gigantic multi-colored heart lighting up the darkness. Although I have no experience with heights, I will challenge myself to ascend a very tall rope ladder, attached to a hovering helicopter, dirigible, tall tree, high structure, or the roof of an indoor high ceiling. To be presented in New York, the worldâ€™s most internationally diverse community, I will be steadied by more than 100 collaborators, one from each nation or tribe on earth. When I reach the apex, my fellow performers, each holding a unique brightly-colored LED strand constituting my cape, will power on a gigantic artwork illuminating the darkness. So unified in my fleshed-out version of an interconnected world, these 200 individuals will serve as role models, as a micro-level spiritual force intended to create macro-level worldwide harmony.

I do not deny the innate human need for competition; rather, I suggest that instead of fighting over ownership of things and places, we should contest each other for the benefit of all to create the most protective and sustainable housing; delicious and nutritious recipes; beautiful and functional clothing; etc. We are all invited to participate with me to see how together we can accept our innate competitive nature and use it to fuel compassion and build community.
