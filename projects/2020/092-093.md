“It’s for you” was a simple performance that took place at LadyFestCLT. LadyFestCLT is an annual festival showcasing performance, dance and film works by female and femme identifying artists. I was standing in a made up world of mute pink inviting the audience to take a phone call. The audio said, “hey it’s me, just calling to say you’re enough.” A phrase wrapped in radical softness that I often long to hear. The concept of the piece felt very simple and straightforward….or so I thought. I would offer the phone to passing by or intrigued audience members and simply say, “it’s for you”. The audience would then hear a ring tone and someone on the other line say “hey it’s me, just calling to say you’re enough”. The sad part or unexpected part was that a lot of people heard, “hey it’s me, just calling to say you’re a mess.” Which totally changed the piece and made me think - do people hear what they want? Do they not think that someone, an artist like me, would want to call them enough?
