The Performance walk “The Boy Who Cried Wolf” is based on the tale of John Hookham Frere. The tale concerns a shepherd boy who repeatedly tricks nearby villagers into thinking wolves are attacking his flock. When a wolf actually does appear and the boy again calls for help, the villagers believe that it is another false alarm and the sheep are eaten by the wolf. In later English-language poetic versions of the fable, the wolf also eats the boy.
With this performance I want to bethink about the fear of the unknown, considering migration and the colonial history of the place where I come from, Colombia, and the place where I currently live, Denmark.
The performance happened on the 12th of October, the day where Christopher Columbus initiated the colonialization of America and the biggest genocide in human history. The “Taínos” in the Dominican Republic, opened their arms to the Spanish conquerors, they were the first indigenous community having contact with the Spanish. In response, the conquerors raped, tortured, killed and erased their whole culture.
Nowadays, other groups of humans travel the world, escaping war, hunger, inequality, with no other attempt than looking for better places to live.
