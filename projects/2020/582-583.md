"Plant time" is an intervention in the midst of one of the busiest shopping streets in Europe, via del Corso in Rome. 

The performance is a collaboration with a plant. The artist, sitting in the middle of the street, practices a mode of embodied attunement with the plant. How can a human body learn time from a plant? Plant's time as opposite to fast-paced human time.

"Plant time" is part of the Festival de Performance CUERPAS Intenacional (Valpara√≠so, Chile).
