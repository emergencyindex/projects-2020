For this performance I used my sleight of hand and household materials to draw parallels between the domestic female role and its representation in ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) videos. “Subversion of a Glove” mimics the feminine choreography of AMSR performance, and its use of mundane objects paired with comforting audio and movements. The gentle fondling and examination of the gloves call attention to the traditional role of the glove and its wearer, all while making rather unpalatable sounds.

The performance opens with two hands outstretched in front of a black background. The forearms are strikingly pale and the nails long and almond-shaped. They fondle a pair of yellow latex cleaning gloves and a bottle of Palmolive dish soap. The gloves are stretched, snapped, and pulled onto the hands one by one after being filled with the blue liquid soap. The bottle squeaks crudely as it refills with air. As the hands enter the gloves the soap spills out to the floor below and the room is silent aside from the steady dripping. The disembodied hands move gracefully to remove the gloves and they fall to the floor leaving slick shiny hands. The hands pose elegantly, only for a moment and are quickly supplied with pot mitts. The pot mitts are then stuffed to the brim with a heavy helping of mashed potatoes. Fly away bits of mash hit the ground with a thud. Then the hands stuff themselves into the pot mitts with a dull smacking sound and are pulled off again with greater sticky difficulty. The hands then begin to delicately and purposefully wipe the chunks of mash of each finger, once again revealing their dainty silhouette. 

The scene leaves the viewer entranced, yet uncomfortable. They are forced to confront the hyper feminine visuals and pair them with the unpleasant experience of action’s sound. The performance serves as an utterance of female performance in conjunction with anti-comfort.
