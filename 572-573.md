Letting Go/Letting In features a large wooden frame wrapped in stretched, waxed muslin that was hand filled with sand from the beach. I stabbed holes through the muslin to let the sand leak out and pour onto the ground. Through this act I meld my known landscapes together, connecting the coastline to my current desert home. This performance symbolizes the connection between the two biomes that I have feverishly worked to categorize and separate mentally. I let go of previous notions of what I can comprehend and allow myself to reclaim control of both mental space and physical earth as a place I can belong.
