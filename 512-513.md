“It’s for you” was a simple performance that took place at LadyFestCLT. LadyFestCLT is an annual festival showcasing performance, dance and film works by female and femme-identifying artists. I was standing in a made-up world of mute pink inviting the audience to take a phone call. The audio said, “Hey it’s me, just calling to say you’re enough.” A phrase wrapped in radical softness that I often long to hear. The concept of the piece felt very simple and straightforward. . . Or so I thought. I would offer the phone to passersby or intrigued audience members and simply say, “It’s for you.” The audience would then hear a ringtone and someone on the other line say, “Hey it’s me, just calling to say you’re enough.” The sad or unexpected part was that a lot of people heard, “Hey it’s me, just calling to say you’re a mess.” Which totally changed the piece and made me think—Do people hear what they want? Do they not think that someone, an artist like me, would want to tell them they are enough?
