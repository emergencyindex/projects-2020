This was a private performance held in a patrimonial house in the historic district of Montevideo. A group of five people were invited to experience an intimate gathering with pop music and the idiosyncrasy related to pop culture.

The performance was presented as a mixture of a concert and a meet and greet. It included a reception, a two-parts acoustic piano concert and a meticulously crafted dinner with the performer. The audience is invited to join a gathering full of complicity. Everyone is expected to play a part and feed the pop-filled fantasy. The experience is theatrical, immersive and raw.

My intention is to reflect on the notion of truth, fiction, stardom, fame and pop culture.
