How to Rhythm was a performance lecture with Chris Reeves on voice and Breanne Trammell on drums. The performance happened once (October 11th, 2020) on the second level back porch of Public Storage, a project space in Trammell’s home in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and was repeated many times as an archived instagram story. Trammell, an amateur drummer, accompanied Reeves, a creative researcher and art historian, in a voice to drum conversation about altering rhythm. The conversation between Reeves and Trammell’s percussion covered the idea that if you alter rhythm, which is to say, reconsider the beat poetically or metaphorically, you can reduce one’s alignment to the homogeneity of capitalist speed. Recalibrating the rhythm of daily life allows for encounters that are otherwise elided in capitalist time (i.e. friendship). The utopian notion of this performance was to consider that if we can craft techniques to create conditions for slowing down (as showcased by the occasionally off-time of Trammell’s drum beat) we might better see our daily life and potentials for new modes of thinking and moving through the world. Thirty 4-page takeaway publications, with Reeves’ text and other rhythm related ephemera, were left in a brochure box affixed to the fence outside of Public Storage for any passerby to take. Many weeks after the end of this performance, Trammell found one of Reeves’ socks he had left behind buried in the blankets of the bed in the spare room where he stayed during this performance.
