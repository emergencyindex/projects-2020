In dealing with the intense separation and destruction of community due to the pandemic, I found myself coiled in a battle of will against the Judge that lives inside of me. The Judge likes to tell me that I am no good, that I am a failure, that I am in fact NOT a dancer (that one hurts). I like to tell the Judge to shove off, leave me alone, stop talking. And then I don't dance.

The year of isolation and identity crisis continued on, all the while I was (somewhat unbeknownst to me) still dancing. I was forced inside, in my bedroom, away from people, and I danced there and used my phone to capture what I was doing. I thought nothing of it, and the Judge thought it was laughable. It was a way to pass time, mostly.

It was also a way to learn how to mourn and fight at the same time. Trump continued to erode the threads of our reality, I was living back at home in the same room that housed childhood abuse, fires raged all around me (literally, and metaphorically), and my dog of twelve years passed away. I had to figure out how to mourn and fight at the same time, and I did that through passing the time dancing in my bedroom with my phone on record.

At the end of the year, I needed a recent work example to submit to a program I was applying for (a program I have practically no chance of receiving, but I nonetheless applied), and so I tried to compile the videos of myself dancing in my bedroom, my backyard, the park. And I discovered how many hours I had collected, how many places and t-shirts and angles I had explored. I began editing, and cried through the process until it was done.

Watching the film feels like watching me. It's stunned the Judgeâ€”she ran out of insults. The civil war is not over, but I think now I might be winning.
