Since 1997, I’ve been exploring the motif of the heart. When I started performing in 2000, I appropriated natural elements for their sacred and profane symbologies. In 2009, I underwent cardiac surgery for the placement of my aortic valve prosthesis. It is precisely the projection of this surgery—images of which were captured by my son—that is seen in this work.

The performance took place in my studio and was presented through a video on November 26, 2020 at the Continuo Latidoamericano de Performance 2020 event, Corpografia en Contexto.

Due to COVID-19, I was totally alone in my studio during the performance. I filmed myself using a camcorder and enlarged the surgical images with a projector attached to a tripod. In the final video, images of my cardiac surgery are superimposed onto my inert body positioned on a table. These overlapping images put the body’s interior and exterior in dialogue.
