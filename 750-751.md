The heart is one of the elements that I use in my artistic work, since 1997.
In 2000, when I started performing actions, I appropriated the natural elements, Heart (of pig) and Fish, for their sacred and profane symbologies, to present my ideas through Performance.
It so happens that in 2009 I underwent cardiac surgery for the placement of aortic valve prosthesis, and it is precisely the projection of this surgery (whose images were captured by my doctor son) that are seen in this current work, together with my inert body.
This performance was performed in October 2020, in my studio and presented on November 26, 2020 at the CONTINUO Latidoamericano de Performance 2020 event, Corpografia en Contexto.
The idea comes up against one of the topics addressed and discussed a lot today, in this event: * Violence against women, physical, mental, psychological *. The impotence and pain that we often feel when the feminine is subjugated by the masculine; also resulting in a dialogue between the outer and the inner envelope body.
