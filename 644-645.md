The performance “Escalda Pés” aims to share an active participation with the public, woven through touch, an unraveling of sensations, and building senses through the feet. It is a method of relaxation and of contact with ancient healing habits. Held at the virtual event MIZURA, its action plan unfolds as follows: I am sitting on a chair and around me are all the objects to do the action (a sound ocean background, a basin, orange towels, two shells, a electric pitcher, a glass with cloves and cinnamon, coconut soap, a herb sprayer, a thermos with cold water). I wash my feet and tell the viewer about my perceptions during the performance. In this event, I started to perform the action as an unfolding of concerns that could not be expressed fully. With this purpose, I center relational experience, proposing that the viewer participate in the work of art. In a virtual world where art is only able to be experienced visually, this breaks with logic and points to other ways of receiving it. Thus, this reception by the body calls for participation through relational objects, moving them or passing them on the skin. These objects are extracted from everyday life: water, shells, towels; it is as if they were for the viewer’s body, a kind of anthropophagy of creation. Creating situations of bodily relaxation, derived from the memory of my grandmother washing my feet as a child. My grandmother provided me with that moment at night, before sleeping, and in this memory I established a place of protection and affection. These actions keep my grandmother alive. Within this childhood memory, I can see her again, even after her death.
