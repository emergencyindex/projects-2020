Alone or with friends, find an appealing drain. Circle it for some time and talk about whatever is on your mind. You could also laugh, cry, scream, sing, or talk directly into the drain.

Coming out of various conversations over the preceding years, the crumbling political landscape in the US, and more local shifts in the “performance art scene” in NYC; in winter 2019/20 we were discussing “Circling the Drain” as a “curatorial platform” for a group event. The complications of Covid added another layer of complexity around “what to do”. At the beginning of July, april says to Honey, let’s just do the score on July 4th (US Independence Day). april made family reunion style t-shirts. We met up and found a nice drain and performed the score in our t-shirts. We left a circle in the grass.

Circling the drain - To be in rapid decline or a state of downfall, especially as leading to inevitable utter failure or destruction.
