“Demystifying the Narrative” is an experimental voice improvisation performed on a handmade e-textile interactive instrument. This work is situated at the intersection between sonic art performance and a mixed-media/textile installation combined with a new electronic musical interface. Reflecting on the turbulent and notable year of 2020, I explore the dominant narratives in the cultural and media landscape through an abstract expression of sounds and visual representation via handmade installation. Upon touching each button (made with a ball of steel wool) with a fingertip, it will trigger a pre-recorded audio sound file.  While performing on this new custom made audio-visual e-textile instrument, my voice is improvised via a looping station. Overall, this work captures the sounds of repetition, repudiation, contradiction, and omission while representing chaos, instability, despair, and unsightly beauty via a large-scale interactive installation. In doing so, it captures various voices that were silenced, heard, repeated, and contradicted as well as a collective and individual outcry.
