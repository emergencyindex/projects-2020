In “NMK 108” I address the silencing suffered by women in the sexist and patriarchal daily life in which I find myself inserted.

I sat down in front of the people who were there to attend the event and sewed my mouth with a curved stainless steel needle and dental floss. There, it was important for me to deal with the silencing that we women suffer on a daily basis. I concluded by cutting the line and letting out a howl as I got up from my chair, then left the space. Neither the breaking of the line nor the scream had been programmed, as I had conceived only an image of the sewn-up mouth, which, for me, was important to materialize in performance; the rest was a consequence of the crossings felt in my body, during the performance. I didn’t limit the audience’s place, I entered with my own chair and left the space with it, so as not to configure a previous scenario, as I wasn’t staging but performing what I understand by performance-art-life.
