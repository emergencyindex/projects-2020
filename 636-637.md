“Trigger…Trigger…” takes place over a Zoom call that is live-streamed to an audience. The performance is a narration that interrogates the Gothic Imperialist genre by using vampires as a metaphor to blur the specific, personal, political, and bodily. This is accomplished via the narration of a story taking place between the window and screen that is told through associative linking, found footage, internet searches, and flashbacks. By using a shared screen to open clips and review drawings, I use a confessional mode of narration to explore the fear of blood, invasion, penetration of boundaries, and loss of self-control. 

Made remotely during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown, the performance begins with me recollecting my experience of spatial and temporal dislocation that emerged from momentary confinement as well as from living in both the UK and Australia for a long time. The narration then transitions to the seaside town of Whitby, which was the setting of Bram Stoker’s *Dracula*. Whitby also carries the legacy of being the departure point for Captain Cook, which ultimately marked the commencement of Australia’s colonization.
