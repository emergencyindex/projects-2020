"Trigger…Trigger…" is a performance which takes place as a Zoom call which is live streamed to an audience. The work comprises a live narration of a story which takes place between the window and the screen told through told through associative linking, found footage, internet searches, flashbacks, the confessional and the re-occurring metaphor of the Vampire. Looking to the Gothic Imperialist genre the narration begins to blur the specific, personal, political and bodily. 

Made remotely throughout the first UK COVID-19 lockdown the performance begins with a personal recollection of my own experience of spatial and temporal dislocation of momentary confinement and long term living between two places (UK and Australia). The narration then moves to Bram Stokers setting of Dracula in the UK Seaside town of Whitby, a site I could not get to, and the town’s legacy as the departure point of Captain Cook and commencement of Australia’s colonisation. The performances uses the platform of the shared screen to pull open clips and flick through drawings as I narrate through the confessional a felt experience of the fear of blood, threat of invasion, penetration of boundaries and of the loss of self-control.
