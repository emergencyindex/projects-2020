“60 Pounds of Pressure,” created in the initial weeks of the pandemic and lockdown in Texas, was in direct response to the young nurse in Georgia who was found dead in her home with her four-year-old daughter sitting by her side. As a single mother of two children, my chest became tight and unbearably heavy as I reflected on the sacrifices being made and the devastating and immeasurable losses we are all witnessing. I did not know this woman or her child, but as a single mother of two kids, I immediately wondered, if I became ill, who would care for the children and if worse, I died, how long would my children have to sit with my body before someone found me? It was at this time I taped up emergency instructions for my children—who to call, our address and how to unlock the front gate to get help. The precariousness of the situation began to settle in. In an effort to momentarily equalize the internal pressure with the outside force, I placed 60 pounds of bricks onto my chest, bearing the weight of my son’s and my daughter’s combined weight, and tried to breathe.
