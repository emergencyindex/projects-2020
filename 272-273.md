SORROW is a solo dance performance and a theater monologue in one.
In this work there is a strong philosophical layer. We use two different disciplines, dance and texts, who are both independent on each other. Still there is a strong relationship in timing and movement qualities. Retained and drawn movements alternate with powerful and expressive dance phrases. At the same time, the narrator tells a story. He lets the words float on a soundscape. Dance, sound, image and voice coexist in a democratic way. Four elements are equal. The beauty of the dance is in contrast with the horror story based on the book “The vice-consul” by the French writer Marguerite Duras and the lithograph with the same name by Vincent van Gogh: SORROW. 
About a young girl who has to leave the country where she was born. 
Homeless, hungry and no protection. The story of the book is written in 1966, and the story is taking place around hundred years ago, but at the same time it can be a modern novel written in today’s time. Still comparable with the fugitives of today.
