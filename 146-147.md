As we are in social isolation times, a lot of performance festivals happened on web spaces. This one I enjoyed was developed by an Indian collective, Hexxyduxxybox, based in Delhi, as we performed from our places. During these times, I was in my partner’s house, working in a tiny space. I was thinking of ways to be protected from the virus and all the political problems that came with this crisis in Brazil. So, I made an action scene that revolved around tiny movements. I built small sculpture pieces and put them on my body, and I made them dance with my breath. So, the pieces are up and down. Sometimes, some of them fall over while others keep dancing with the artist’s breathing, with no expectancy or climax.
