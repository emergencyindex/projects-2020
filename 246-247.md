Responding to the absence of invigilators during the pandemic, and too the public from galleries which now put their shows on view from the street and offered virtual exhibitions online, we devised this performance to address this curious dichotomy. Conscious of our displacement from our workplaces, we were also aware of the shared constraint upon one's experience of art in either real life through a window from the street or a window online.We therefore chose to create our own space where each view could exist in parallel. Images of these spaces were coupled with perceptual impressions of both and included the presence of a DROSS invigilator. The process of the performance was as follows: A DROSS documenter recorded images of galleries where the exhibitions could be seen in whole or part from the street. In addition, they also made a brief written record of their experience of the place. Both images and text were then sent to a DROSS netizen at another location.  Receiving these in staggered messages as further galleries were located and documented, the netizen used this time to locate each gallery's presence online. They then took screenshots of each site and recorded their impressions. Each set of texts and images made were then added to the first corresponding set, and then both sets were forwarded to a DROSS compiler to assemble.  Collaging both sets of images with that of an invigilator into a new three-dimensional space reminiscent of a video installation, the compiler then juxtaposed this new image with the textual impressions of the two operatives. The resulting image and texts were then posted to social media platforms thereby signaling to the first DROSS operative that one cycle of the relay was complete. Once a set was posted, an invigilator-themed meme was added to direct the audience to the next post elsewhere. The relay continued in this fashion and the performance was concluded in around four hours.

Conceived and executed during the 2020 lockdown in the UK "\[Absence/Presence\]" is our second remote communication relay. In this performance a D R O S S documenter recorded images at _XXXXX_ a live event in which invigilators were absent. These images were then sent in sequence to a D R O S S member at another location where they were printed and cut, and then had the image of an invigilator pasted on to the document. The resulting collage was then forwarded by the printer to a D R O S S interpreter elsewhere where they were received and performed as a live online commentary with each image concluding with a short text. The documenter was then informed by text message that this part of the relay was complete, and then the process was repeated until the live event drew to a close. Once concluded, the D R O S S printer then collates, reprints, and binds the completed images and texts thereby creating a zine. In solidarity with the workers at Tate who are conspicuously absent from their galleries both on and offline, this action is appended by a set of limited edition postcards.

"\[Absence/Presence\]" responds to both the absence of work for casual gallery staff due to the closure of institutions during the pandemic, and to the presence of numerous exhibitions and live events taking advantage of this vacuum by staging events on and offline that require no workers. Developed as a strategy to examine the relationship between subjectivation and the performative, this intervention draws attention to the presence of artist invigilators, or in this case while in an indefinite hiatus, their absence.
