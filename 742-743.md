In the wake of the US presidential election, my troupe Legacy Fatale was invited to perform and march amongst a larger consort of acclaimed artists and activists in New York City. We gathered under the banners of the Vote Feminist Parade and the Wide Awakes 2020 movement. 

Assembled together with our respective banners, costumes, and signs, we raised awareness on social issues while encouraging everyone to vote. 

On this occasion, "The Urban Punk Amazons Vote" performance took place as a public participatory happening at Times Square. Legacy Fatale members led the audience into a series of three signature movements that embodied empowerment, interconnectivity and collective healing.
