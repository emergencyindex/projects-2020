This performance was when shutdowns started to happen at the beginning of the pandemic. I was forced to leave my studio and cancel live performances. Everything seemed upside down without any certainty of what was going to happen next. Online live streaming shows started to pop up on twitch, facebook, instagram and youtube as an outlet for everyone who lost the ability to perform live. I was invited to perform at one of these events and I took this opportunity to showcase a new character, in what I saw was a growing digital wasteland. I was feeling trapped in my apartment in West Philadelphia and I felt like I was slowly changing into a creature myself- in this case a goblin/witch hybrid. Outside my walls seemed like a wasteland, the digital world was trying to grasp what was lost, and on the inside I felt disintegrated. During the day I would teach printmaking online, while feeling more isolated and decrepit as the days passed. Seeing the miserable faces of my students in a digital classroom felt cold, mechanical, and soul-sucking. The concept of time slowly became obsolete and I saw myself slowly transform into a different being. This character portrayed in this performance represented what I was seeing through a digital lense. Digital decay is around the room breaking up the background and the foreground. You can see a figure in a witch mask with markings on its face. Behind the mask is a painted face and long hair.The thing I constantly asked myself- "Is this being actually me?" Using live broadcasting software, I overlay myself with videos that are distorted and manipulated. While overlaying videos I have an audio software program that's mangling sound clips into a distortion mess that eventually becomes unrecognizable at times. Trying to merge my being with the content I was listening to and watching during a global pandemic. The constant thing in this 33 minute performance  is me looking at the screen with dead eyes. Just like the faces we are all familiar with during this time. We are still living on a screen trying to move forward with our everyday lives, but now with bandwidth issues, glitches, digital manipulation, and even more distaste for our surroundings. But this goblin/witch will keep staring on, lifeless, trying to find meaning out of chaos.
