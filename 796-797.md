Using a <span class="ITALIC">raspador</span>, a tool used to make <span class="ITALIC">raspados</span> (Mexican style snow cones), I scrape away at a 50 lb block of ice for three and a half hours. This is my literal translation of abolishing ICE, the system that has affected many Latinx communities. This piece was performed as a response to the inhumane actions Immigration and Customs Enforcement has carried out on people, especially children. 

The three and a half hour durational piece was performed outside of a cemetery in Los Angeles in a residential area and was viewed by multiple surrounding residents. Because of the pandemic, a formal live performance gathering could not be executed and so the piece was compressed down and composed into a five minute video work.
