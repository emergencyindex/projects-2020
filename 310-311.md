In “Portraying Endings of the Year 2020” I perform a portrait of 2020 as a year of endings.

My practice is rooted in the “Colour Spectrum of 11 Spaces” which consists of 11 books of each their colour that each stands for an aspect of our being: White (Beginnings), Blue (Wisdom), Orange (Pleasure), Red (Battle), Green (Love), Yellow (Balance), Purple (Language); Beige (Time and Space); Brown (Nourishment);  Pink (Skin - the Private, the Intimate and the Erotic); and Black (Death). These 11 colours are a language to speak about our being, and I unfold them in various mediums and materials. In the spatial performances, I use these colours to portray anything from a situation, an institution or our past in spaces such as a parliament, nature or iconic antique sites. I perform to the space rather than an audience and express the meeting between the existential topic of the book and the space around me, in me - or in us. When performing I am not conscious of the choice of movement, but give in to the feeling of the book as it meets the space. It is only afterwards that the performance becomes a narrative and interpretation. It is therefore crucial to collaborate with a photographer to capture the essence and narrative of the performance. 

“Portraying Endings of the Year 2020” was a spatial performance in relation to my 11th book *The Black Book - on Death* that portrayed the year that shut down the world. The performance took place at the very end of the year in two locations in nature in Denmark. It started in a plantation of young trees and moved to an old forrest with tall trees only to end in the first location, so when seeing the documentation of the performance it goes in a loop. I wore a black silk dress and scarf, and a velvet cape. The latter I took off during the performance so as to feel the cold winter against my skin. I performed a spontaneous, felt dance that became a choreography with the black veils in the dress, being absorbed by it or seeing through it, being drawn to the cold earth, held by trees or morphing with them or their remains. Endings are important, they invite us to face what it is we need to let go, and if we do, they are followed by a new beginning.
