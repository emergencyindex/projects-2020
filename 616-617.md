A reflection on my past and how I see my body currently is presenting in my video performances. When I was younger, I developed and grew much faster than many of my classmates. I was given the nickname Courtree because of how tall I am and by the way I would tower over my friends I had long limbs like a tree and was able to use my flexibility as a dancer to make myself have these branch-like features. 

In Branching Limbs, the video is of myself interacting with the trees as a silhouette. The way I can move, contort, and extend my body like branches makes me one with nature. I hide my female figure in the shadows amongst the trees and the viewers is only able to catch a few glimpses of my undistorted body. Moving slowly, posing, and giving glimpses of my figure, then blending back into the trees is my personal connection to nature by showing an appreciation for my long limbs. Yet, distorting the image because of the silhouette, sunlight, and movement of my feminine figure shows how I want to hide myself for these qualities because of  my self-consciousness. Through performing I have leaned to accept my image and realize the beauty in the body I have.
