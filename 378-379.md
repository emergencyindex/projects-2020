The performance “Divide et Impera” was invented in May 2020. I had an image before my eyes; i chop water. As the message “Divide et Impera” is a key principle of strategy, and we all fight the battles of our lives in one way or another. My life is like splitting water with an ax. I probably have too little strength, chopping too little intensity to handle the water. Or maybe you can’t demand so much? 
In ancient myths, water symbolizes primordial chaos. My towing suit is a hint of Western civilization. Performance - 20 min. chopping water with an ax.
