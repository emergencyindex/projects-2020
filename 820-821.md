The performance begins with me painting my hands in gold. I sit on a chair and take a powerful plant, called the sword of ogum, to balance in a sign of devotion. The action lasts as long as I can sustain it.

 

Every time I tell myself about the existence of a body, I move to a remote beginning. From the void, how does a movement start? I pay attention and go linearly through the senses. I identify the first existence with the need for air  and I inflate the chest. I feel the force of this presence spreading through an axis, which finds the ground and culminates in the celestial sphere. I have seen the gesture that, regardless of the movement of the hands, brings with it the possibility of manifestation. In durational action, I am willing to keep seven swords for ogum (this is a plant with the same name as the orisha) standing and with a forged effort, I understand that the trajectories of balance always have the center in common, which in strength is gravity and in direction, "Nadir."
