“Tela Preta” is a photo performance that questions the aesthetic stereotype associated with the image of black women and their confrontations under the optics of the whitening culture that positions black bodies as inadequate bodies. The photographic composition consisted of small strips of paper scattered across the face, with phrases black women often hear in what refers to the idea of beauty: Targeted skin; A cocky person; Too dark; More golden; Can you fix your hair?; Not suitable for your skin; Thinner nose; Not our profile. The action seeks to reflect on beauty standards with Eurocentric references that erase the racial identity of black women, resuming the discussion about self-esteem and how these associations reinforce the need to transform the aesthetic references, with a racial focus on black women. The photo performance was held at the online event Mizura in Rede, exposed through the Facebook page Mizura and Instagram profile @mizura.performance on July 07, 2020.
