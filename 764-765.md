The Museum is hiring freelance Bigfoot Hunters. Through the practice of Sagan Standard in empirical science, Bigfoot, among other cryptids, remains in cryptozoology, because no one was able to ‘prove’ that Bigfoot exists. Through the act of The Museum hiring Bigfoot hunters, it brings up the questions of: 1) Why do we hunt Bigfoot? 2) Why is a body needed as evidence? 3) Do institutions create the ‘truth’ or do institutions support our ‘truth’? 4)What is the futurity of contemporary cryptozoology if field research remains unimaginative? 

This participatory experimental performance aims to question the core research methods of contemporary cryptozoology, the relationship of objects with institutions, and the nature of evidence and archives. Through the emails, a 1-paged application form and 4-paged employee agreement, participants are confronted by their identity of a Bigfoot hunter, pursuits of ‘evidence’ and their relationship to objects, and an institution. 

‘The Museum is hiring bigfoot hunters!’ is an on-going participatory performance. Since 24 October 2020, we have hired 20 freelance Bigfoot hunters, and 5 employees have sent us their ‘evidence’ of Bigfoot through emails and Instagram DMs. The Museum first made an open call through Instagram then through e-mailing list. Posters were made and circulated. Application Forms and Employee Agreements were sent out through emails, gave in-person, scanned and sent back, signed by both parties, and stamped by The Museum. Participants in this project include folx located in Chicago, Maine, Hong Kong and Texas. ‘Evidence’ received are all saved and dated. All documents were never presented, but saved and uploaded to The Museum’s Google Drive, and evaluated in a written report in the 2020 Annual Report of The Museum, sent out through e-mailing list on 30 December 2020. 

* ‘The Museum’ (2016 -ongoing) is a project that mimics bureaucratic structures in institutions to highlight the ridicules in human behaviours and tempts the audience into participation from their desire. It examines the hows and whys in hierarchical systems and (late-)capitalism through the physical work in the site, and the virtual through social media and website. Alongside satirical video works, The Museum focuses on designing specific administrative documents to different projects for The Museum Unpaid Intern and the audience to fill out, in order to explore the process of authorised existence, the alienation and personalised aspects in bureaucracy, and the systemic violence experienced in and through institutions.
