A cesura is a metrical pause or break in a verse where one phrase ends and another phrase begins. What does it mean to stop, to break, to be in the fracture? <span class="ITALIC">Cesura</span> delves into this space amidst theoretical formulations of the break. A study in putting our attachments into play/pleasure/knowledge/worlds, <span class="ITALIC">Cesura</span> focuses on viscerally transgressive movement, broken transmission, material degradation of moving image, and scoring effect. Engaging Foucault’s preface to his seminal text “Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason,” we hack up the text and stage its live reenactment in a screen-recorded transcription. 

Drawing on our familial archives, Super 8 Footage, the video work of trans peruanx artist and philosopher Giuseppe Campuzano, the 1950 short film <span class="ITALIC">Un Chant d’Amour </span>by Jean Genet which features the uncredited dancing of Coco Le Martiniquais, and sounds from collaborators Ryn Stafford and Lua Girino, we start with sound engineering, editing, automating and overlaying sonic textures to inform new combinations of frequencies. Working separately and together in the digital audio workspace we improvise off each other. Details become portals in a disobedient multitude. The recorded-performance <span class="ITALIC">Cesura</span> celebrates its disorder, lending itself to the power-potential of glitches and errors.
