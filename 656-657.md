Without Quite Knowing is a meditation on change, a reflection of the times it’s been conceived – times in which previously taken for granted certainties have been shaken and can no longer be left unquestioned. The alienation, the lack of direction and frames of meaning that characterize the disruptions like those we have experienced in the past months, find their expression in this performance through disembodied movements, an uncanny technological mediation, and a relentless drive to ask questions.

In a dark room, a low positioned cold light shines over a reclusive plaster sculpted head. Stillness and silence prevail until a voice creeps inside the earphones. The voice belonging to a performer is narrating her thoughts, hesitations, disclosures from the process of making the performance. The audio channels switch in between, we hear different voices, different stories, points of view, from different times and spaces. From the dazing and dizzying audio convolution, a sudden “Why” resonates across the room from the stage. 

“Why should I be moved by anything else than the desire to ask questions?” This question will reverberate throughout the whole performance. 

Three bodies enter the stage one by one. One is silent, one is speaking, and the last one has headphones on, listening.

The relationship of mind and body resurfaces throughout the piece several times, but its most distinct manifestation comes from the very format of the performance which makes extensive use of spoken word juxtaposed with body movement. Gazing at the performers’ moves, I found myself pondering the continuity between thought and movement. Could we think of thought and speech as movements of the mind as body movements are to the body? And what about the opposite, are our body movements our body’s thoughts?
The experience of listening to the performer’s thoughts, which reflect on the making process, while watching the finished result brings a meta-dimension to the role of the audience, as if temporarily inhabiting someone else’s mental space. There’s no sense of breaking the fourth wall—this piece feels like it can’t even be contained by walls.

There are questions, contradictions, disruptions, and sounds. At the bottom of it all, you meet yourself—three versions of yourself that invite you for a ride surrendering to the poetry, the abstraction, the ambiguity, and the open-endedness, which are the preconditions of any great transformation.
