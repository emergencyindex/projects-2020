This performance consisted of becoming one with a wall. I inserted my fist into a hole I found in the wall and raised it, protected by cultural heritage. I filled the hole with cement while keeping my fist raised until the cement dried, then removed it from my hand with a chisel and hammer, leaving the hole in the wall. 

I question the symbols of power, the idea of the wall as an insurmountable barrier.
