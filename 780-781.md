"Hand Dance" is a dance film and collaboration between composer David Lang, choreographer Annie-B Parson, visual artist Ron Erlih, and dancer/choreographer Brittany Engel-Adams. Moved by their premiere date, the eve of the 2020 election, the group wanted to reflect being at this precipice. David Lang's song includes a line about the working class from a Bernie Sanders' speech, and in Lang's hands, the text reads like an aspirational koan. The song inspires an intimate hand dance set in Brittany and Ronâ€™s kitchen in Brooklyn. Throughout the film, hands sourced from public data sets are overlaid on top of Brittany's hand gestures, suggesting a larger world beyond their home.
