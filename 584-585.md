“Harlem After Dark, Unplugged” is a weekly livestream  from the living room of world renowned jazz artist Allan Harris which began on March 17, 2020 in honor of the 101st birthday of the great Nat King Cole. Since that date the stream has been ongoing every Tuesday night at 7:30 PM.  Due to the popularity of the stream, and to reach the European audience that also wanted to tune in, Saturday afternoons were added.  Originally this stream was a solo concert with Allan accompanying himself on guitar, but he added pianist Arcoiris Sandoval and Marty Kenney on bass in May.  Recently with the coronavirus rearing its ugly head again in New York City, Allan is once again going solo for safety.
