During health crises such as COVID-19, the risk of domestic violence and exploitation of women and girls increases. This can be due to tensions at home, the uncertainty generated in families by decreased income, and extended coexistence. Factors like quarantine also engender further obstacles for women and girls who are victims of domestic violence when they are trying to flee risky situations or access protection mechanisms and essential services that could save their lives.

This video performance denounces the very starting point of domestic violence: the economic systems that allow men to earn higher wages than women, which causes women to have decreased access to education and resources. Vulnerable women are often the targets of this abuse since they have fewer resources with which to defend themselves. 

The performance consists of sewing insulting words with a red thread on a rice paper mask. The artist then wears the mask until she can no longer breathe as an act of solidarity. By doing so, the artist hopes the performance can serve as a means of liberation not only for herself, but also for all of the women who cannot breathe because of domestic violence.
