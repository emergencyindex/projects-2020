“Krokottas” was a video performance structured thematically around connection, communication, and healing. It explored the meditative possibilities of isolation and seclusion, and the relation between the decay of sound moving through air and the decay of relational structure as it relates to distance.

Separately, we stood in juxtaposing locations—one of us in a cold, internal location and one of us in an outdoor, natural landscape. Interpolating text from hymns to Dionysus, Hestia, and the Koryvantes, we took turns separately exchanging text, holding our phones in front of our mouths so that we could speak through and for each other, exchanging words of healing to both ourselves and to the viewer. 

To conclude, as one we repeated the greek phrase “<span class="Greek">εκας εκας οστις αλιτρος</span>,” which translates to “be gone, be gone, all that is wicked,” seven times.
