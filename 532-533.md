Currently, many of us experience the world and social interaction through Zoom meetings and through our webcams. Our cyborg bodies extend through the internet longing to touch others in meaningful ways. If we are to succeed, we will have to concoct new intimacies together.

...and i’m a situation is an online performance that presents itself as a Zoom meeting and streamed on Twitch as part of the Imaginary Network Topologies virtual tour curated by Jeff Carey. During the time of COVID-19 pandemic-related social distancing, this piece critically engages with the physical and technological infrastructure that makes our connected world possible. It seeks to establish a kind of cyborg intimacy with the viewer through the use of computer generated secrets created using a Recurrent Neural Network and the live audio and video feed from a Ring brand smart surveillance doorbell.

This work begins with the performer speaking a confession generated by collecting thousands of anonymous secrets from an internet forum and using that text to train a recurrent neural network to create its own secrets. The viewer hears vague clues about the speaker struggling with taboo desires or a conflicting sense of gendered identity. This confession feels intimate and is created out of a merging of technology, the body, and the confessions of numerous anonymous strangers. 

During the next section of the piece, the viewer sees recordings of the live feeds from a Ring smart, surveillance, doorbell placed in the artist’s former and current homes in Kansas City, KS and Morgantown, WV. The smart doorbell is an increasingly ubiquitous fixture of many homes designed to allow the owner to peer out into the world. During pandemic lockdowns this use of the technology inverts its function and welcomes viewers into the privacy of the artist’s homes. It  proposes a model for turning the all-seeing eye of the surveillance camera in on itself by using it to welcome penetration of our private lives by viewers of the video stream. The impersonal surveillance tech becomes a tool for creating intimacy

In the final passage of the piece, the artist performs the role of 3 zoom meeting participants unsuccessfully attempting to read computer generated secrets in unison. Through the intimacy of confession, the viewer witnesses a paradoxical fusing and fracturing of identity: a cyborg intimacy developed for these new, digital, bodies that we are forced to inhabit in the world of seemingly endless Zoom meetings.
