A line was traced with a chalk marker pen along the left handrail of an electric escalator located within Mexico City Metro Station Aquiles Serdán in the direction of Barranca del Muerto. The line followed the escalator’s own course of travel while the pen remained in a fixed position on the ground floor beside the escalator, until an uninterrupted and continuous loop was formed. 

“Hold the Line” took place during the first days of the 2020 coronavirus lockdown. The performance aims to suggest a sense of preservation, and sustaining against the pressures of a difficult situation. While the title and the site may conjure visions of brave soldiers defending a position against an onslaught, the source of the metaphor in fact comes from American football and the line of scrimmage, where the ball sits at the start of each play, beyond which each team would rather not see its opponent progress.
