“One Second Dances” is a collection of one second gestures, movements, moments, and actions that take place in a variety of forms for one second every day. “Dance” in this series is considered in the expanded sense, i.e., in the ecstatic mode of any and all movements justifiable as expressive and with the potential for meaning. Using the restriction of time (one second) is both a novel treatment of this expanded definition of dance and a potent means to capture, even if fleetingly, the practice of everyday life. 

The one second dance of the day is captured and shared on Instagram as a living archive of moments. Taken altogether, they amount to just over six minutes a year, a time capsule of seconds coalescing in an entire kaleidoscope of the seemingly insignificant made tantamount to experience the joy of movement and moving through time and life.
