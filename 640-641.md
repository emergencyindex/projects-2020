"Constant Motion" was a solo performance without audience. The summer solstice occurred on June 20, 2020. I performed in constant motion alone in my studio from 12:44pm CST to 8:44pm CST. The time frame centers, by 4 hours on either side, the actual solstice moment during 4:44pm CST. I performed in front of a small Brinno time lapse camera. I set it to capture my movement every 15 seconds. The resulting video document had a duration of 6 minutes and 25 seconds at 5 frames per second. I edited the piece, added sound and titles, and increased the speed by a power of 2. The edited file documenting my performance "Constant Motion" is 3:38 and documents 8 hours of movement. It was exhibited on Facebook 24 hours later.
