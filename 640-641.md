“Constant Motion” was a solo performance without audience. The summer solstice occurred on June 20, 2020. I performed in constant motion alone in my studio from 12:44 pm CST to 8:44 pm CST. The time frame centers, by four hours on either side, the actual solstice moment during 4:44 pm CST. I performed in front of a small Brinno time lapse camera. I set it to capture my movement every fifteen seconds. The resulting video document had a duration of six minutes and 25 seconds at five frames per second. I edited the piece, added sound and titles, and increased the speed by a power of two. The edited file documenting my performance “Constant Motion” is 3:38 and documents eight hours of movement. It was exhibited on Facebook 24 hours later.
