“Treading Lightly” is a site-responsive performance that I carried-out in the midst of a political, sanitary, environmental, and social crisis.

The action took place near Canyada del Hoyo (Cuenca, Spain), a territory known as Tierra Muerta by the locals due to the many abrupt depressions in the landscape caused by the ground’s subsidence. In my performance, I activated the very edge of these steep depressions by carefully walking barefoot along its edge. 

The performance was a means of addressing ongoing instability in the world while embodying its uncertainty. By walking barefoot, I found the tactile safety of connection with the land, an increased openness to external stimuli that I understand as paramount to face the current challenges of our time, and the more than plausible eventuality of collapse. “Treading Lightly” has been documented through a video that features my movements as well as a background narration that provides context for my actions.
