“Inhale, Exhale” addresses the difficulties of human’s interactions and the limitations that Covid’s situation has imposed. This performance is a 2-hour durational work that involves body endurance. In the first hour, two performers have dynamic movements, and in the second hour, they have static.

The audience is witnessing the performance on the sidewalk across the SAIC’s Washington Window building. Performers are located in the interior and the exterior space of the building, separated by the glass window. They start their action by pushing their bodies against the glass that has separated them while facing one another in a symmetrical or asymmetrical composition that their body creates as they are following each other’s movements. The pressure of flattering the body against the glass puts more tension in the body muscles and performers’ viewpoint, but they get to the point that their movements synched. For the second hour, they stand still while they are only connected to another by stretching their right arm and connecting their hand palm as they meet the glass. Performers leave their spot as 2 hours is finished.
