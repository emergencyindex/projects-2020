“Washing the Car” was performed at the Noel Fine Arts Center at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. My performance was set outside in the sculpture courtyard. It consisted of an unfired clay car sculpture, a hose, and me. I had originally sculpted the clay car into three separate sections, with each section joining together to create a whole. However, the first two sections of the clay car suffered catastrophic damage upon firing when the kiln shelves exploded underneath them. The third section of the car used for this performance remained unfired and was the only surviving product after six months of work. 

The performance began when I entered the space and picked up the hose. I began to spray water on the third and only surviving section of the clay car. The clay was bone dry and began to soak up the water immediately. I continued to douse the car until the whole surface was glistening in the sun. The performance went on like this for one minute. After this minute was up, the clay had absorbed enough water that the structure became weak. Suddenly, the clay car collapsed in on itself and crumbled to the ground in a pool of cold water. I stopped the hose and observed the result of my actions. Then I peacefully dropped the hose and walked away, signaling the end of the performance. 

Through this performance, I am acknowledging the previous failure that occurred when I tried to fire the first two sections of the clay car. I want to embrace this failure and demonstrate how to calmly accept imperfections in the process of making art. Moreover, by performing “Washing the Car,” I hope to share with others the nuanced experiences of jubilation, melancholy, and satisfaction that I ultimately find in the act of destroying my own work.
