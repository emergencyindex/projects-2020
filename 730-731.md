During this second pandemic wave, the imminence of a mass sixth extinction and systemic racial inequity, how do we unlearn the idea of Nature and the Other(s) as distant and different from us? This project is a six-chapter proposition for one-on-one plant-to human interactions exploring an embodied understanding of interdependence. Proposing this work as a multiplicity morphing with the passing of time, each chapter invites humans to relate to black beans (Phaseolus Vulgaris L) through weekly prompts that can be accessed digitally through this platform to be performed at domestic and exhibition spaces. Chapter Sample:

Chapter One.

Inter-Action One:

Take a handful of black beans

and soak them in water for a minute with tender hands.

Put them to rest on a mattress of moist paper towel,

cover them gently with a blanket of tin foil and

water them daily for a week.

Consider: These beans and this body; where do they start and end?

Chapter Two.

Inter-Action One:

Walk towards your sprouted beans.

Listen to the silent verses of Phaseolus Vulgaris L;

its newborn entangled roots and opening leaves

Inter-Action Two:

Ground yourself and connect with the soil under your feet wherever you are.

We come and go only because we are contained by the soil at every step. 

It is estimated that in a handful of soil there are more than seven billion microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protozoa and nematodes), the same number of humans on planet Earth.

Inter-Action Three:

Find an empty vase and some soil.

As you fill the vase, observe the seven billion microorganisms in each handful of soil.

Take your sprouted beans from Chapter One and

separate them gently from the wet paper towel. 

Plant them 2.5 cm. deep and 5 cm. apart, giving enough space to the roots.

Water your beans after planting and then every other day. 

Place Phaseolus Vulgaris L in direct sunlight.

Consider: This soil, this empty vase and these hands, where do they come from, where do they go?

Chapter Three.

Inter-Action One:

Together we can do something that neither can do alone

It is the story of our genes, the air we breathe and the symbiotic relationship between the root nodules of black beans and rhizobia bacteria.

Stand in front of Phaseolus Vulgaris L

Bring your nose next to a leaf

Breath in and out
