This work consists of a minimalist performance involving a custom printed banner. The banner is rolled up and hung from the ceiling. I lay on my back on the floor directly under the banner for an undetermined period of time (in this case, 10 full minutes) doing nothing but looking at the banner hanging above and gradually gripping the attached ropes. After enough time has passed, I pull on the ropes, revealing the text printed on the banner. The banner reads “It’s About Time”. After the banner’s unveiling, I continue to lay still underneath the now unveiled banner for several minutes. 
The performance is simple and tongue-in-cheek. I create both boredom and anticipation by remaining passive for most of the performance. Only in the final moment is the tension relieved. The work is revealed. The statement displayed on the banner is matter of fact. It’s about time something happens during the performance. This performance is also itself about the concept of time.
