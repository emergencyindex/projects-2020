I fill two buckets with water by the waterfront. Walking back and forth from the water’s edge to the top of a container, I carry the buckets on a yoke. The water returns to the sea by running down the front of the container. I struggle to maintain the flow of a waterfall, using only the labour of the human body. This seemingly impossible task recreates a water cycle through a repetitive 5-day process within the assembly of shipping containers at the Wellington Waterfront.
