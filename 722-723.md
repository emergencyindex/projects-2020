Based on the performance "Taped" (1975) by Jill Scott, in which she is affixed with tape to the wall of a museum, here we have a man affixing a body to the floor. Only one hand remains, which, through its red-painted nails, we can identify as the hand of a woman. The idea is to bring to light violence against women, opening up this voluntary / involuntary scorn that we have seen in relation to the growing wave of aggressions toward and deaths of women. The performance took place in two squares with a large circulation of people: one in the upper part of the city and inside the University of Coimbra (Praça Dom Dinis) and the other downtown (Praça 8 de maio), both in Coimbra, Portugal. This performance is part of a series of actions that discuss the issue of gender violence called "crueza."
