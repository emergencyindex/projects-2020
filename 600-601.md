“Rite of Passage’’ is an intermediate time, the corporeality of the rites, the regurgitation of the “Old” and the annunciation of the “New” before the impermanence of the BEING in this world. Generating lives in the continuous exercise of making way for my peers to follow...a perforation of the body anchored in the practices of collective affections and comforts, producing bodies of struggles, after all, where there is oppression there will be resistance and ours is made of the joining of spells and enchantments of our ancestors.

“Rite of Passage” or “a rite for mine to pass” is a poetry of interweaving of the Body, Memory and Ancestrality, as well as a work of ritual corporeality, developed in the artistic residency: “Hinterland as Residence Space.” The performance consisted of a ritual, with the body as the fertile passage, the epistemological path, marked by an ethnicity that was colonized and violated, but that today claims its historical repair, from which it builds a network of affections and collective comforts together with his peers. Thus, at the crossroads of a bridge, for approximately 40 minutes he choreographs “new possible worlds” so that these bodies become present and alive at the end of the world. The use of sacred/mystical materials (earth, candles, rosary, crown, frown, bell and white costume) potentiates the opening of portals so that your ancestors can join in the same chain of strength and corporeality.
