Performed between the dates of March 29, 2020 and May 12, 2020, during the first and strictest lockdown of the Covid-19 Pandemic in the UK. I took a different household object out with me on my daily permitted walk. During this period, government guidelines stated that individuals should only access the outside to exercise, once a day. Each day I walked the same circular route, close to my rural home. 

I took the following household objects (in chronological order);

Jug of fake flowers, mug, curtain, saucepan, chair, coat hanger, pillow, wire oven shelf, mirror, extension lead, shower head, bird ornament, bread bin, tea pot, dustpan, drawer, mop bucket, bathmat, plate, tray, toaster, horse head brass, broom, coffee pot, washing up sponge, lamp, sofa cushion, door mat, cutlery tray, duvet, wooden spoon, hairdryer, landline telephone, big grey rug, pink storage container, chalk board, wooden ship wall plaque, TV, magazine file, fridge drawer, toilet brush and holder, utensil pot, kitchen bin, metal lampshade and coffee table.

Objects that normally spend their whole lives indoors were liberated one by one to join me on a walk outside, escaping the confines of the home. The daily action was physically witnessed by the environment in which we walked, and by any other walkers and runners we passed on the route.
