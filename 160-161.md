In response to the new needs arising from the worldwide spread of COVID-19, this project explores the difficulties in maintaining interpersonal physical distance in public spaces. As a result, the artist redeems the traditional nineteenth century crinoline, adjusting its structure to create “The New Armor,” a circular artifact which has a circumference of almost 10 meters, a diameter of 3 meters and a radius of 1.5 meters. Created with 35 meters of fiberglass bars and more than 70 meters of high visibility reflective tapes, the new armour is lightweight and offers great flexibility. The performance consists of walking through the streets of the different neighborhoods of the city, wearing the new armor. The artistic action shows once more the social impact that art can have, acting as a means of information that can teach, in a graphic and universal way, the minimum safety distance that people should keep.
