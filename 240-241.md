“Inner galaxies” is a constellation of thoughts and sounds developed over the last few strange and distinct months of 2020. A collection of poetic text, improvised sound, body, and nature. Performed and live streamed from London, UK on October 24, 2020 for The Kerouac International Poetry and Performance Festival, hosted in Vigo, Galicia, New York and Mexico. The performance was bilingual in an English-Spanish score of five parts:

part one. body inside language—interweaving popular sayings referring to hands, playing with their coincidence and narrative in time, meaning and sound. A mix of bodily words and birds (parakeets from field recording) that inhabit our local park. A reflection on commonality, daily activities, hand washing and walking, playing with narratives of power structures.

part two. information/disinformation—a physical exploration of packaging from online deliveries whilst vocally challenging the virtual and visceral spaces between information and disinformation. 

part three. galaxy of bird shit—processing relations between micro/macro civilisations in a “shit” universe. A poetical and political intervention digesting the pandemic experience in isolation.

part four. aaaaaah—saxo-mouth-harp-electric-guitar extended reverberations into sonic shadows. An improvised portrait of shared experiences that question ideas of rhythm &amp; togetherness.

part five. nebulous state—politics and nature following the life of a house spider.
