The body as a language for holding, recreating, and releasing trauma. Movement, voice, touch, consumption, transformation, dreams. Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic becomes extremely difficult when we are forced to continue on relentlessly within the system of capitalism.

I performed this for the camera. I put on my makeup, told a story that I dreamt, then recited anti-capitalists mantras of self love. Throughout it all, I was dancing, drinking, and screaming.
