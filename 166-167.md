Pinina Flandes (Yecid Calderón) and Juan Fernando Mena performed as the contingent collective  La Sorora Dinamita, a variation of the famous group of Colombian-Mexican cumbia group La Sonora Dinamita. The purpose of La Sorora Dinamita is to make the concept of sisterhood (*sororidad*) known to people outside academic circles and, at the same time, to generate reflection within the academy and feminist groups about the concept.

La Sorora Dinamita turned the balcony of their apartment into a stage from which to perform lipsyncs of some famous Colombian cumbias beloved in Mexico. In the intervals between the seven selected cumbias they performed, they played recordings of Latin American women living in different parts of the world, speaking on their notion of sisterhood. Pinina took advantage of the microphone and invited passersby to reflect on sisterhood and to dance along to the music. 

Given the requirements for social distancing caused by the COVID pandemic, the performance was a way to intervene in the little crowded public space below, to dance together and come to know sisterhood.
