A vast spectral light sphere surrounds me. I become one with the light. It’s filling me up slowly with a need to express and communicate.

I react to the illuminating elements of Radical Light—an exhibition by Anne Katrine Senstad. The sharp glowing neon is evoking energy. Intimately, I am channelling the energy and connecting with the people of Tallinn and the history of the former submarine factory at Kai Art Center. I call on the light joik, let it flow, and build up in the space. I read the light and the people surrounded by it through my inner voice, and I let it free. Everybody is invited to take part in an emotional transformation, conjuring a renewed state of presence.
