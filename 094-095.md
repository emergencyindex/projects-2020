“Reset” was created specifically for a virtual presentation during the quarantine due to the social and environmental consequences of the pandemic. “Reset” was also created on the original idea, “Keep our spirit shining in the dark, as something new arises.” I used Butoh inspired dance to express how vulnerable we are as human beings. The honesty of the moment that happens when we are in despair; however, we never lose hope.  

I’m so proud of this piece as it was born only about 1 month after the lockdown began under this challenging time. We weren’t even familiar with any of these new digital venues, such as Zoom, Twitch, and other similar platforms to create a live show, let alone to set a tiny space at home to look appealing for the audience.
