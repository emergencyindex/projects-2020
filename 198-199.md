Audre Lorde&apos;s speech, “The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action,” sheds light on the margins of rhetoric in the realm of public speech. She examines factors that may cause some people to remain silent while enabling others to speak and act, which lies at the base of this performance. The brain is cognitively unable to be angry and grateful at the same time. Anger can also lead to action, and this constructive anger is the most useful, to turn a hurtful/hateful event into a call for change.

Dressed as a stereotypical, simplified image of a male Sunday painter in a business suit and a beret, I made quick, expressive portraits. These drawings then were turned into masks that were used in the final performance. In these one-on-one sessions, whilst drawing, we discussed anger management techniques; the different methodologies, such as playing loud aggressive music, screaming, or internalising the anger by disassociation were brought up publicly. Themes of misuse of power to silence those who are perceived as different through sexism, verbal abuse, violence and sexualised aggression, shame, the taboo, and hostile social environments all passed through these conversations.

I used these masks, the audience and my own voice, music from a Casio keyboard, inflatables and costumes to create an interactive talk show. The final stage of the performance was to create a temporary angry mob. This temporary collective was invited to swear and shout in their preferred language and storm out the gates of the project space, into the public realm, united through rage and no longer silenced.
