This work was displayed to an audience in an empty studio space set up like a black box theater with a lighting rig on each side of the stage. The recorded performance was projected via Vimeo. 

The audience first sees an image of a party scene set to jazz music. Dancers pretend to hold drinks, laugh, and dance in unison. The music changes and the lights dim to a continuous sound of “om.” Miu, the main character, sits facing upstage in a Sukhasana pose and wearing a green and white striped supermarket worker’s uniform. 

All the other dancers enter, scurrying around in everyday clothes. The score turns to New York City traffic sounds. The dancers make a line to resemble a bus stop. Then, all the dancers exit.

The music shifts to elevator-style jazz music, the kind played in supermarkets. A dancer enters en pointe, holding a shopping basket. A second dancer enters dressed as a supermarket employee, carrying five toilet paper rolls in a stack. She places them down, and all other dancers enter, dressed as workers and moving robotically throughout the space. One dancer holding a karaoke mic makes an announcement as though over a loudspeaker: *only one roll of toilet paper is allowed*.

Meanwhile, the dancer en pointe takes all but one roll of toilet paper in her basket. Two other dancers dressed as customers begin to fight over the last roll. Other dancers try to break up the fight, yelling, *stop I need some too!*

The music stops, and all dancers freeze like statues. Miu begins to speak slowly: *STOP FIGHTING, START SHARING.* She takes the rolls from the basket and gives one to each dancer. 

Here, the music changes to an original song with a house beat. Dancers transform into backing dancers for Miu, who takes the microphone and begins to lip sync the words. All the dancers use the toilet paper as a prop—twirling it over their heads, rolling it on the floor towards the camera, and walking on it as though it’s a runway. The dancers roll around on the toilet-paper-covered stage, and the lights fade to black. 

This is the story of Miu who worked in a supermarket, practiced yoga, and had a dream of becoming a star. We wanted to make a light-hearted and fun performance piece in what has been a dark time for many. There *is* enough for everyone.
